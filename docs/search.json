    "text": "What I wanted in a blog platform\nFor a long time, I had an unfulfilled wish list for a blog platform:\n\nCan write posts in Markdown\nEasy to deploy to Github\nCan script in Python\n\nA large number of platforms fulfills the first two items, but I struggled to find one that fulfilled the last item. I finally found Pelican, but I found it too clunky and started to worry that it was not going to be maintained for long. Therefore, I oscillated between Jekyll and Hugo (using blogdown) for a long time. I liked blogdown a lot, but whenever I’m switching a lot between R and Python, my brain gets really unhappy.\n\n\nQuarto has everything, and more\nRecently, I found Quarto that ticks all my boxes and solves a lot of other problems. My feeling when using Quarto must be similar to the feeling of Python programmers when they started using Jupyter (because they never used RStudio) or similar to what I felt when, as an analyst, started using RStudio. Things just work.\nWhen I was initially switching between Jekyll and Hugo, one of the most annoying things was Jekyll preferred posts as files, while blogdown preferred posts as directories. RStudio even provides a function bundle_site() to convert files to directories. Now, when I’m converting to Quarto, I thought I needed to write such a function in Python.\nAgain, it turns out that “things just work”. Quarto accepts both directores and files as posts and rendered everything correctly. So I’m going to draw the “Quarto Spiral” instead, just to celebrate!\n\n\nExample from Hello, Quarto!\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A line plot on a polar axis"

    "section": "",
    "text": "It’s not only applicable to the internet. I find that it works in a lot of other interactions, including work interactions.\nCunningham’s Law is frequently presented as a way to exploit a bias that people potentially have against “things being wrong”. While the “bias exploitation” story may be true, there’s also an economic reason why using Cunningham’s Law is a nice thing to do.\nA common example of when posting the wrong answer is expected is in Stack Overflow: when asking your question, it’s a good practice to show what you already tried and what’s not working (essentially posting the wrong answer).\nThe advantage of such a protocol is that it makes it easier on the people trying to help. Consider the example “Who is Luke’s father?”. Asked as a question, there’s a lot of context missing: Luke the Apostle? Luke Skywalker? Luke Wilson? My neighbor Luke?\nOn the other hand, the incorrect statement “Han Solo is Luke’s father” provides a lot of additional context: this is about Star Wars, and it also provides how the question asker expects the answer to look like. Economically, it lowers the production cost of an answer, making it easier to get one.\n… and if there’s something wrong with my theory above, I’m sure someone is going to correct me!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Microsoft Surface Pro 3 was the right computer for me at the time I got it, but as time went by my position changed substantially, and it ceased to be appropriate for me.\nWhen I got the Surface, the core of my work consisted in traveling, having conference calls and light emailing and spreadsheet work. As time went by, my work went back to creating analytics, creating presentations about analytics, and traveling. There is where the screen of the Surface becomes a liability at 12 inches. I wanted something bigger.\nAnd boy, is the P51 bigger. It has a 15-inch screen and a power brick that alone is twice as heavy as the Surface Pro. It’s big enough to have a keyboard that comes with a numeric keypad. Since I still have to travel a lot, I chose the P51 over the beefier 17-inch P71. The P71 won’t even fit in my somewhat large Osprey backpack. The P51 barely fits.\nDue to some standardization constraints, my P51 is the 1920x1080 version with touch screen. It has 32 Gb of RAM and a 500 Gb SSD. It has the i7 7820HQ running at 2.9 GHz and a Quadro M2200 GPU. If I had the option, I’d choose the 4K screen and the Xeon processor, but I did not have that option.\nThe battery life is surprisingly good. For the kind of things that I do in planes (writing blog posts, editing presentations, light programming), the battery seems to last well over 8h without Wi-Fi and about 7h with Wi-Fi. I have yet to run out of battery in a flight. I have read that the earlier version of the P51, the P50, would trip the circuit breaker of a plane if you tried to plug it in. I have not attempted to plug in the P51 yet.\nThe P51 is usable in the Premium Economy seats and, of course, in business and first class seats, but I have the impression that it would not fit well in the economy class of carriers that have a very small distance between seats (like American Airlines domestic flights), especially if the person in front of you reclines their seat. It works well in exit seats.\nOne gripe I had about the Surface Pro 3 was that I always had to travel with a USB hub, a mouse, and a couple mini-DisplayPort adapters. The P51 comes with a mechanical keyboard, the beloved TrackPoint, a good TouchPad, 4 USB ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, an Ethernet port, an HDMI port, and, to my surprise, a mini-DisplayPort, so I get to keep all the adapters I had for the Surface.\nI’ve also considered the P51-S. The slimmer version trades off some power (it goes from quad-core to dual-core) for a thinner, lighter frame. I think the P51-S would also have been a solid choice, but I think it would force me to do most of my work from a workstation and/or a server that I’d need to remote into frequently, adding to the stress of versioning and synchronizing. Somewhat counter-intuitively, I chose the heavier computer because I travel a lot, as it has enough power for me to do the vast majority of my work on it and use a server or workstation just for the realhardcore stuff.\nIn summary, the Lenovo P51 is a great computer for the traveling data scientist. It’s powerful enough to be used as your primary machine. For me, it’s near the top limit of a computer that is comfortable to travel with, but still within that limit. I got used to it in no time and completely gave up my desktop workstation."

If I said the quote to someone, ‘Knowledge is power, France is Bacon’ they nodded knowingly. Or someone might say, ‘Knowledge is power’ and I’d finish the quote ‘France is Bacon’ and they wouldn’t look at me like I’d said something very odd but thoughtfully agree. I did ask a teacher what did ‘Knowledge is power, France is bacon’ mean and got a full 10-minute explanation of the Knowledge is power bit but nothing on ‘France is bacon’. When I prompted further explanation by saying ‘France is Bacon?’ in a questioning tone I just got a ‘yes’. At 12 I didn’t have the confidence to press it further. I just accepted it as something I’d never understand.\nIt wasn’t until years later I saw it written down that the penny dropped.”\nI can’t imagine the number of things that I think I understand but that are like “France is Bacon”."

    "text": "This seemingly simple problem is harder than it looks. People don’t (normally) quietly stare at urinals for several minutes, but that can happen to computer screens (e.g., watching a movie or presentation, reading a document).\nNewer phones and tablets use eye tracking to save battery. They can figure out whether you’re looking at a screen, and if you’re not, lock. It works well, but these are devices that you almost always hold close to your face, so they can keep a camera pointing at you all the time. If you cover the camera or use an external monitor, you start having problems. With computers, I have a very strong preference for using external monitors, so I’m already in the problem situation to begin with. The solution could be to add a sensor to each monitor or camera, but given the thousands of models available, that could get complicated.\nDuring my long career, I’ve seen many pranks on people that left their computers unlocked. Some places look down at the person who left the computer unlocked, but I actually prefer the places that chastise the pranksters: instead of pranking, it would be better if they locked the computer and kindly had a word with the forgetful person.\nIn any case, one of my favorite Windows 11 features (apparently also present in Windows 10) is the ability to lock my computer automatically when I move away from it.\nThe way to do that is a little convoluted: you need to pair your Bluetooth phone with your computer (which, of course, also needs to have Bluetooth), and when your computer, using Bluetooth, detects that your phone moved away from your computer, it will automatically lock.\nFrom my description above, you probably already appreciate how a seemingly simple problem that we can solve for a urinal can be hard to solve even if your device has a lot more features.\nThe people who implemented the feature still couldn’t solve all problems. What to do if the user doesn’t have their phone today? Current solution: just show an error message. What to do if the user moves away but leaves the phone nearby? We detect phones, not users, so it will leave it unlocked.\nIn any case, I’m glad to see that computers of 2020s are inching closer to the toilets of the early 2000s."

    "text": "This may be because a few years ago, my (then) manager taught me a trick: when in doubt, err on the side of hiring people.\nI looked at my statistics a while back and I really don’t say “yes” that much more than my peers. It’s just a little more. When I shadowed other interviewers, I noticed that my questions are just as hard, if not harder. If I noticed one difference, it’s that I tend to start with a quick, easier question, which usually cost me less than five minutes, and I’m then quickly at or above the average difficulty level of my peer interviewers.\nI do this because it is extremely common for the interviewee to be nervous during an interview. Like on the movie Gladiator, you don’t know what will come out when the gates open, even though you prepared a lot for it. If the first question throws the interviewee off, it’s often hard for them to regain confidence. It’s quicksand.\n\nI like #interview questions that are “adaptive”, like the GMAT, meaning that you can make them easier or harder by changing small things. Sometimes, people would actually be able to do the hard version of the question, but they’re nervous and need to start with the easy one.\nAs commonplace as it is, the interview process is very imperfect, and usually tends to yield false negatives: meaning that it fails people that would have succeeded. Given how hard the process is, people that are “on the margin” are more likely to be good hires than not. I have not regretted any bets I’ve made."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hurricane Irma happened when I was out on a business trip, and my family was in Parkland, FL. Forecasts went from “maybe it will hit you” to “if you stay you’ll surely die” to “I think it’s not going to hit you anymore” to “Phew, it will miss” in four days.\nWe did a lot of preparation using conditional probabilities. In our assessment, it would be very unlikely for the hurricane to hit both the East and West coast. So we decided to move the family from Parkland, FL to Tampa (back then, the hurricane was forecasted to hit the East coast), but to book hotels in both Pensacola (Florida panhandle) and Jacksonville, FL while we waited for new forecasts.\nAs days went by, the forecasts moved further and further West. On Saturday 2 AM, the forecast was that the hurricane would hit Tampa as a Category 4, so staying there was too risky. And then we had to decide between moving to the Florida panhandle, moving to Jacksonville and incredibly, going back to Parkland, near Fort Lauderdale.\nThe uncertainty seemed higher for places that were north of Tampa: it was hard to tell whether the hurricane would turn either way in 3 days. On the other hand, the forecasts are better in close proximity to the hurricane, and it seemed pretty certain that the hurricane would miss the Parkland/Boca Raton area. So we made the somewhat gutsy call that my wife would come back to Parkland with the kids.\nThere’s surely an element of luck to all of this, but the outcome was positive. We had very minor damage in our house: a couple plants and a downspout. I think the total amount of damage is going to be less than $100. It’s hard to be precise because there may be damage that is hard to see, like on the roof. We did not lose power, internet or even satellite TV. The hardest part was the stress.\nOn Monday morning the winds were back to normal. There’s still a lot of debris around the county. I’m supposed to fly back home tomorrow, if the airport opens, and hopefully I’ll be able to get a ride home. This was more of a suspense than a horror movie. Many people were not as lucky as we were and we’ll now see how we can help them."

    "text": "The concept dates from around 1929. The original text is longer, but a concise version is: “Do not take a fence down if you don’t know why it was put up in the first place.”\nNew managers and senior resources frequently want to change a lot of things. We are, after all, hired because of our deep expertise and experience. It’s not uncommon for a senior, experienced person to think that what was done before them was “wrong” and that they could easily do what’s “right”.\nThe reality is that, most times, whomever did the previous version is an accomplished professional had to make lots of decisions under constrained resources. I find that it’s usually hubris from my side to think that I can easily understand and solve all those problems quicker and better than they did. Fences don’t sprout from the ground - there’s a reason why a specific fence was put up there in the first place.\nI frequently learn a lot when trying to understand the reasons why the original decisions were made. Occasionally, the original solution can really be improved on, but after understanding why it was made in the first place I also learn of constraints I didn’t know. In many other cases, I learn of constraints that would actually create significant problems for the new idea I had, and that saves me and everyone else significant time.\nWhen I was less experienced and less careful, I brought down plenty of fences unnecessarily, and was later surprised to find escaped sheep on the road and farmers yelling at me"

At the end, I’d be done. Back then, I didn’t know about the #pomodoro method, which can actually be used in a similar way.\nAfter that, the “dwell time” of tasks that annoyed me dropped sharply: once I booked the time, the task was mostly out of my mind.

If you consistently deliver, are helpful and everybody knows it, that also tends to follow you around.\nThe tech market is simultaneously surprisingly large (sometimes you don’t know people in your own company) and surprisingly small (someone you knew a decade ago reaches out with a new opportunity).

That’s called pluralistic ignorance. It’s a bad outcome for teams: the majority of team members knows something is missing, but each one thinks that they’re wrong. The team never realizes that the majority was right all along until it’s too late. The team makes a wrong decision.\nOne way to break out of pluralistic ignorance is to have someone is brave enough to ask a question, even if it is a naive, tedious or ill-phrased one. That can open the floodgates. It doesn’t matter the question was not that good by any measure, it can break the spell of pluralistic ignorance."

Of course, mathy Computer Science studies that we were, we all knew that the gravitational acceleration would be \\(g \\approx 9.8 m/s^2\\).\nMeasuring it, however, it’s not very easy. First, remember that this is in the early 90s in Brazil, so digital cameras were very rare. Part of the problem is that 9.8 meters (approximately 30 feet) is quite high, so if we wanted our experiment to take around 1s, we would need a big ladder. Or, as it happened, we’d need to run an experiment that took less than a second for each run. In a class with 25 students, that was the preferred route.\nWe set up a vertical track attached to a device that would spark every 1/60 of a second, and we attached grid paper to the track. This is called a Behr free fall apparatus.\nWe would release the device from the top of the track, and the sparks would mark the grid paper. We would then manually measure the distances between the sparks and the differences between the distances would tell us the acceleration. In theory. Again, remember this is the early 90s, so there’s no Windows 95 or Excel easily available, there were several steps that were prone to error.\nThe desired outcome was not only to calculate the acceleration due to gravity, but also to generate a lab report."

Another thing that worked was going through the experiment more than once. What did not work was to perform the experiment and then go to where the computers were to type up a report from memory.\nI thought that was very insightful, shortly afterwards, we would learn about Donald Knuth’s proposed paradigm of literate programming, which lives on in Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown and that is very popular in data science today. Behind it is the same concept of explanations interspersed with technical work to produce something that is reproducible and easy to understand."

David argues that aspiring data scientists should blog for technical practice, to build a portfolio, and to get feedback. Experienced data scientists might benefit for similar reasons, but not exactly the same.\nSimilar to “practicing”, blogging about technical topics helps you learn how to communicate better about them, and also helps you learn how to write better research reports. Similar to “portfolio”, it signals a data scientist’s body of work. For an early-in-career data scientist, it may be more showing that you can do analysis, but for an experienced data scientist is more about what type of analysis you like to do. Finally, I think that “feedback” also works differently for early-in-career and experienced data scientists. I’m not sure random strangers in the internet will sweep in and correct your posts, but you can find out what people are reading and sharing. You may be surprised when you learn what parts of your work people find interesting."

Having been into both Microsoft and FAANG and having participated on hundreds of recruiting processes for both (as an interviewer, hiring manager and interviewee), I have #feelings about this. Lots of feelings.\nFirst off, let’s get my economist way of thinking and potential biases out of the way. By revealed preference, you know I prefer Microsoft to FAANG, at least under the conditions that were offered to me. I recently chose to come back to work for Microsoft from FAANG (I also had recent offers from other FAANGs). Therefore, take my words with a grain of salt.\nAlso, given recent performance, FAANGs are not an investment thing anymore. For pop-investing fans, the acronym is now MAMAA, one of which is Microsoft (Netflix was dropped).\nBut this doesn’t matter, since the main argument about FAANGs was about recruiting: FAANGs (allegedly) pay better than Microsoft. There are non-FAANG companies that also (at least used to) pay extremely well (e.g., Airbnb and Uber). When recruiters compete against FAANGs, it’s a difficult fight. It’s not uncommon to have a FAANG offer that is 50% over other companies. You don’t have to spend a lot of time in Blind to find out that in terms of total compensation, FAANGs pay very well.\nI can tell you: it’s great to be paid very well. I can also tell you: it’s not the only thing that matters.\nAs a data scientist, I think a lot about optimization problems. If your personal career optimization problem is solving for maximizing short-term total compensation (TC), FAANGs are great. And, as that same recruiter wrote in a subsequent post, there’s no shame on having that goal.\nBut maybe you want to optimize for other things: work/life balance, impact, stress, learning, risk, work environment. Short-term TC is super important, especially in when you want to get a house, buy a car, get established, pay those student loans. But after some point, it may matter less to you. Privilege check: this is about choosing between high degrees of privilege, and I’m blessed and humbled to have the opportunity to choose, as many in the tech area do.\nFor the opportunities that were available to me, Microsoft was by far the best option for what I was optimizing for: learning, working with people I admire, work life balance, being able to talk about my work, having lasting impact on the world, and very good compensation with lower stock market risk.\nAs any person that knows about Goodhart’s Law or Charlie Munger can tell you, you get what you optimize for. When you’re choosing what you are optimizing for, make sure that it is what you really want."

The question went like “Can that chatbot do X?”. I answered that “No, it can’t do that - that was something that I had thought about but ended up never implementing it”.

If the signal is misinterpreted, problems that the expert could solve may end up being directed to the non-expert, and that may result in solvable problems not being solved.\nThere are upsides, however. One upside is that a lot of trivial problems and issues gets filtered from the expert and solved by the non-expert instead. Another upside is that the non-expert will likely get better over time, if only to maintain the façade. Presumably the gain in skills from the non-expert will be faster than for the expert, so overall the skills for the company overall will increase."

We could rule out the Tableau Designer if they lack programming or statistical skills. We could rule out the ML Researcher if they don’t have domain expertise. We could rule out the Python programmer if they don’t know Math and/or have domain expertise. Perhaps this makes Data Scientists hard to find (it would justify their salary)!\nDepending what the company you work for was before the Data Science profession started, a lot of people from different jobs may have re-branded themselves as data scientists. I think Conway’s diagram is helpful as it points to where people should focus their development in order to be more effective as data scientists. For example, former Economists most likely need more hacking skills, former computer scientists need more Statistics and domain expertise, and former management/technical consultants likely need more Statistics.\nIt can also serve as a check for inclusiveness. For example, a team of former machine learning engineers is struggling to deliver meaningful projects because they lack domain expertise. However, they can’t hire domain experts because the domain experts keep failing the machine learning interviews. Comically, the machine learning engineers think that domain expertise “is easy”.\n\n\n\nEverything you don’t know is easy\n\n\nThe most useful part of Conway’s diagram for me is that I’ve time and again observed projects that don’t have representatives that can communicate well with each other in all three areas to fail. Conway’s diagram even makes it easy to show how the project failed (“nobody with domain expertise”, “missing knowledge of statistics”). Having a single person that can do all three is difficult, but it certainly solves the communication problem. That being hard or impossible, having specialists that can communicate with each other will usually be sufficient."

    "section": "Should data science teams be centralized or distributed?",
    "text": "Should data science teams be centralized or distributed?\nI was happy to find that Jonathan Nolis has the same opinion as I do: that a data science team works best when distributed into client areas. In addition, we agree that if you distribute your data science team among several different client areas, you have to find a way of keeping the data scientists feeling as if they’re part of a cohesive group. And that’s hard.\nFor me, a key part of the argument to distribute data scientists in client areas relies on Drew Conway’s (ancient) Data Science Venn diagram.\n\n\n\nData Science Venn Diagram\n\n\nAssigning data scientists to a client area will help build the “Substantive Expertise” part of the diagram. A common trap here is “Well, we can do the same if we keep the data scientists centralized and give them specializations that match the client areas.”\nAlthough I think that can work, I worry about what happens when data scientists have downtime.\n\nIncentives for client areas and centralized data science teams\nIn my observations (low sample size), the client areas usually have a better sense of ROI1 - if they invest resources on something, they expect returns. On the other hand, most centralized data science teams I’ve seen have two problems: data scientists hired without a clear purpose and an incentive to overengineering: a current example is to use Deep Learning where a regression would do.\n\n\n\nOverengineering\n\n\nIt may be simply that client areas are more mature and battle worn than centralized data science groups, at least in my experience. I think that if a data scientist is assigned to a client area and there’s downtime, they’ll put the data scientist to work in business intelligence or decision analysis. On the other hand, if the data scientist is assigned to a centralized data science group, they’ll be pulled into a project away from their “client area specialization” or will find a way to work in something novel that’s cool (as of 2018, autoencoders, GANs or something with “Bayesian” in its name).\nAnd here the ROI appears again: as the data scientist works through the BI project, they’ll learn more about the data and more about the business and its data, and that investment has a large likelihood of return in their next project in the same group. Whereas if they spend this time learning a new technique, the return is uncertain.\n\n\nBut wait, if you do that, data scientists will never learn something new\nHere’s where the hard part of keeping a data scientist community pays off. That community may be weekly “Lunch & Learns” if the number of data scientists is small, or quarterly conferences if the number of data scientists is very big and your company is very, very rich.\nIf you don’t forcefully push towards having such a community, it’s very likely that data scientists will reinvent the wheel over and over again, and if their time is as precious as their high salary indicates, that will be a waste of money. For example, if you have 5 data scientists It’s better to spend $50k on travel to bring them together a few times a year than to have one of them wasting three months reinventing something that another of them already done.\n\n\nWhere I disagree with Jonathan Nolis\nIn the podcast, Jonathan suggests that the data scientists should be assigned to client areas and report “solid line” to a Chief Data Scientist, while reporting “dotted line” to the client areas. I would do the opposite. However, listening to the podcast, it seems that Jonathan didn’t have a strong opinion that one is better than the other, and again in agreement, neither do I.\nOne big advantage of having a “solid line” group of data scientists is career advancement. It’s easier to compare data scientists with other data scientists. Leaving them in the client areas will require to compare them with other members of the client area, and they may be seen as wizards (and overvalued) or “too hard to understand”, and be undervalued.\nOne disadvantage is estimating the value of the data scientist to the client area. Data scientists that are more creative in their value calculations or less scrupulous are probably going to get ahead. I’ve lost count of the times that a data science project saved more revenue than the customer ever had.\n\n\nSo, what do I do?\nHonestly, if you’re starting a data science team, your best bet is to hire someone like Jonathan or Drew Conway to plan the team for you. You’re going to spend a lot of money on Data Science, and it’s important to make sure that it will be well spent.\nIf you’re on a budget and all you can invest is the time to read some blog posts, well… you probably don’t have enough money to hire data scientists. But if you do, I recommend assigning them to the client areas and keeping them there. Even when they’re not doing modeling or machine learning, they’re learning more about the business and its data."

The most damaging shortcuts are the ones that damage reproducibility, especially when creating documentation for my projects. It’s too easy to copy and paste into PowerPoint and be done with the communications for a talk. Some of my talks, especially about my most successful product, have many similar versions with one or two slides changed. Someone asks me for a slightly shorter or slightly longer talk and I suddenly have a new file with one or two extra (or hidden) slides that I may need to maintain.

Over time, I found that although some things have a steep learning curve, the return on the time investment was very positive. I also tried Ubuntu, Fedora and Red Hat, and although I could get productive more quickly, keeping them configured to my taste later was harder - when something broke it took me longer to understand what it was.\nThere are several things that still don’t work well in Linux. One of the most vexing is having a high-DPI display. It’s somewhat hard to configure it. It works well in KDE, but KDE has tearing issues. It doesn’t work too well in GNOME unless you use Wayland, which brings a host of different issues. You can make everything a lot worse by using the NVidia proprietary driver with Wayland, but it’s needed if you want to use the GPU efficiently.\nSo although I managed to configure my Arch installation to use GNOME under Wayland and use the NVidia proprietary driver, it’s very unstable. Native applications tend to run, but many applications crash in comical ways: resizing Google Chrome under Wayland is a sure way to cause a crash, for example."

    "text": "One of the most important things to know is that the way of getting better at interviewing is… well, interviewing! It’s good to be on both sides of the table, both as an interviewer and as an interviewee. Practice helps you to do better, but it also helps you see where you’re not doing well.\nI have two policies about interviewing. The first policy is that I will accept an invitation to interview at least once a year, even if I’m happy with my job, which I frequently am. I don’t like wasting people’s time, so it has to be a place that I would really consider going to if the process worked out. The reason for that policy is that I once spent many years without interviewing and when a good opportunity showed up, I was very out of practice, and I think a lot of me not getting it was because I barely understood how the process worked in other companies. I’m not sure I’ll keep this policy.\nThe second policy, which I’m even less sure of its helpfulness, is that once I decide that I’m willing to change jobs, I will be fairly open to interview for lots of different things. For example, if I get invited to interview for my dream job and decide that I would leave my current job for it, I’ll interview for lots of other jobs as well. This gives me a lot of extra work and stress (interviewing is hard), but it also allows me to practice a lot and find my weaker spots, and to have a backup in case things don’t work out.\nOne of the hardest questions for me is “why do you want to leave your current job and join us”. I tend to like the job I have, and also tend to be more forthcoming than the average interviewee. My sincere answer is usually far away from “this is my dream job”. It’s possible that I have only succeeded in my latest interview because it’s a place that I really, really, really love and admire in a company that I love and admire, too. It was sincerely my dream job and team. In any case, after some practice in interviews (and lots of help from Katie Baird, PCC) I started to get better at answering that question, while still being sincere, which led to far more offers/quasi-offers.\nTo wrap this up, I want to recognize that my experience above is one of extreme privilege: I have been around for a long time, and I’m extremely fortunate to be invited to interview. A large number of people are in earlier stages, when even getting an interview is hard. If you are in that situation, I think the takeaway is to still try to get as much practice as you can (by being open even after you’re far into some process, by doing mock interviews in both sides of the table, etc.). I hope your time will come and I hope that I can help."

    "text": "How to get noticed (but not in the way you want)\nWhenever I post a position, I usually suggest to potential candidates: “if the position interests you and you have the basic qualifications, apply directly through the link.”\nInvariably, many candidates reply to the post with “Interested”, or send me a message asking to review their CV, or send me a message asking me to book time with them to discuss their fit to the position. This doesn’t help these candidates, for reasons I explained before and that I’ll summarize below.\nImagine there are two identical candidates that qualify for the position. Candidate A applies immediately. Candidate B sends a message asking the hiring manager to review their CV or profile before they apply, and perhaps also asks to meet.\nUsually, the reason why the hiring manager is hiring is because there’s more work to be done than their team can currently handle. So the hiring manager is likely to be very busy, and it will take some time for them to answer. Their calendar may be super full.\nBy the time the manager finally answers, even if the answer is “yes, your basic qualifications match what was posted in the position”, Candidate A is probably already doing their phone screen. By the time Candidate B meets with the hiring manager to decide whether to apply, Candidate A is receiving an offer.\nIn addition, after all that effort, the hiring manager could observe that Candidate B didn’t read instructions attentively, needs help with very simple tasks, and does not show “bias for action”.\nI have a keyboard shortcut that essentially types: “If you fit the basic qualifications and the position interests you, just apply directly through the link I provided”.\nThat approach works for me because of my particular situation: many good candidates, attractive company, lots of positions. In other situations (e.g., a smaller company) I’d probably have another approach: for example, I might offer to review resumes.\nThe key point is to interact with the hiring manager in the way they are suggesting. They are trying to help you succeed. If they’re suggesting you should apply, then apply. If they’re asking for you to send them a resume or reply with “Interested”, then that’s the best approach."

Telling me that you didn’t apply to an entry level position because it says it requires a Ph.D. and 25+ years of experience would help uncover an error.\nNote that these are my personal preferences, and the preferences of other hiring managers can vary."

    "text": "The finance team of a company was trying to forecast their monthly cash. An analyst had been doing that for about ten years, and had a record of cash actually received per month going back all those years. He realized that some months, like December, received a lot more cash than others, like February.\nThe analyst used Excel to calculate the percentage change for each month. For example, if the company received $100M in October 2009 and $80M in November 2009, he recorded -20% for Nov 2009. To calculate November 2021, he would take the average of the percentage changes for November over the last 10 years (2011 to 2020) and apply it to the October 2020 number.\nIt didn’t work too well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was around 20%. For some months, the forecast missed by a lot, causing significant problems, including having to urgently borrow cash at significant cost. Eventually, the company decided to hire a data science consulting company.\nThe consulting company immediately concluded that the problem was due to lack of data. Ten years of monthly data resulted in just 120 data points. To do data science, they said, they needed more than that. Luckily, the analyst had also been recording the daily data. Now, with thousands of data points, the consulting company used an LSTM deep learning model to forecast cash by day. It also didn’t work too well, but when they aggregated it by month, it did a lot better than the analyst’s original forecast: MAPE was closer to 10%.\nThe project was celebrated as a success. A press release was issued, promoting the benefits of using cloud technologies and deep learning for more accurate financial forecasting. The person who hired the consultants was promoted.\nA few months later, a new data scientist joined the company, looked at the monthly data, and used the Excel FORECAST.ETS function to achieve a MAPE of 1% in seconds. This time, there was no press release.\nWhen starting a data science project, be careful about the baseline you’re using to determine success. Choosing a poor baseline (like the original analyst model) can result in thinking that fairly bad outcomes (like the one from the LSTM model) are good, just because they’re better than horrible outcomes. I’ve seen a number of cases in which a simple heuristic handily beat a complicated ML model."

I had to answer a (cute) questionnaire asking about my dog, her weight and her food preferences. The result was a recommended food plan with a calculated number of calories, and a discounted price for a few weeks (I don’t remember if it was two or three).\n\n\nWhat I didn’t like\nThe first thing I didn’t like was that the number of calories was on the low side. Using another web calculator, I found that my dog would need 946kcal/day. The Farmer’s Dog calculator gave me less than 500kcal/day, about half of what I thought I needed, and about half of what I was currently feeding her.\nThe second thing was the price: after removing the initial discount, the price was about the same of the food I was currently using… but for half the calories.\nThe next thing was my own fault: I was counting on using the food right away, but it arrives deeply frozen, and I needed to wait about 36h for it to unfreeze. The package was a little unwieldly: the food comes as a paste in sealed plastic bag. I needed to use scissors to cut the top of the package and press out the paste into the bowl. It is hard to measure the exact quantity, and easy to get one’s hand dirty, which makes it harder to convince my kids to do it. Measuring the right amount is also tricky.\nThe food needs to be frozen, defrosted and kept refrigerated. That makes it inconvenient to use it in travel.\nDid I hate it? For the first few days I thought I would, but…\n\n\nWhat I liked\nThe Farmer’s Dog excels where it matters: the dog eats the food like there’s no tomorrow. I wouldn’t even need to clean the bowl. The only other case when I see she eating like that when she’s eating human food. Being a careful scientist, I thought this could be because she was hungry due to the lower calories, but I tested that she devours the food even after getting a lot of calories from other foods in prior meals. She really likes the food. I think it’s a staple of VC investments that they want to sell solutions rather than products, and this solved my main problem.\nThe downside: I had to adjust the calorie count up, which meant that the Farmer’s Dog is now more expensive than my previous food."

When I do, it’s because my conscious mind reminded me that I’m not making eye contact and pushed me to do it. It takes effort and concentration. That doesn’t help me as an interviewee. When I’m an interviewer, I tell people that I like taking copious notes (because it’s true) and this usually sets them at ease with my lack of eye contact.\nI also suffer from “meeting recovery syndrome”, a concept I learned about in the book “The Surprising Science of Meetings”. After meeting people, especially a large group, I need some time alone to recover, usually by being alone for at least 15 minutes.\nBy knowing these things about myself, I can plan around them better. For example, I book time to work on an individual project (e.g., writing a promotion document) after a large meeting, and book breaks after small meetings.

That’s a lot to keep track of. Sometimes, I wanted to find something that I wrote and it would take me a while.\nNow, I use Quarto for everything.\nMy biggest audience is on LinkedIn, but it’s not that easy to post technical content. To my knowledge, there are three ways to do it:\n\nYou can write an article\nYou can create a training\nYou can post an external link\n\nThe problem of writing an article on LinkedIn is that the editor is good for text pieces but unfriendly for technical content, especially for code and source control. In addition, the editor requires the writer to edit online all the time. In practice, I mostly copied and pasted.\nThe problem of creating a training is that I think it’s a lot of work. I never tried, and maybe it’s easier than I think it is, but just getting started seems like a lot.\nInstead of using LinkedIn, a very popular option is to use Medium or, more specifically, “Towards Data Science” (TDS), a subset of Medium articles focused on data science. I frequently find articles I like in TDS, but it’s somewhat paywalled. You get just a few free articles for free. For authors, the advantages are that TDS is widely promoted in search results and that authors get paid. Not enough to quit a job and write for TDS, but enough to buy a couple books per year. Other options are newsletters, but it starts to feel too much like a job.\nThe LinkedIn algorithm seems to punish posts that only point users to an external article. I can understand that: this type of post is unlikely to generate any engagement inside of LinkedIn: people just “click out”.\nIn any case, the problem I wanted to solve was to be able to write more technical posts from time to time, but still be able to post those to LinkedIn automatically. To write technical posts in my blog, I started using #Quarto and loving it. Recently, I wrote some code to configure Quarto to post automatically to LinkedIn. The code scans my Quarto files and uses the LinkedIn API to post them. If they fit fully as text, it posts them as a normal post. If they’re too large, it posts the beginning of the article and a link to my blog.\nNow, when I write a blog post (technical or non-technical) or even real work code, I can choose to automatically post it to LinkedIn and Twitter by simply adding some front-matter to my file.\nThis solves a large number of problems for me. With that, I now do all my writing in VS Code. I don’t need to use Buffer anymore. I even have version control.\nNow I just need to write interesting stuff!"

You should not be surprised that their goal is the same as the hiring manager’s: they want to get to the “offer accepted” stage.\nThe first thing they do is to check if you’re not already in an active process with another recruiter. If you are, they’re going to let that process finish first, and you would probably be better served by waiting until that process ends before applying.\nRecruiters manage multiple positions and hundreds of candidates, and it’s hard to keep track of complex details for everyone, such as when to contact you back in case you fail one of your 20 attempts. Recruiters do an incredibly good job of keeping track of candidates, and succeed at superhuman levels, but you can help yourself by focusing on one position at a time.\nI am not sure whether applying to multiple positions in the same company simultaneously works well. One advantage is that it may get you started early - if two teams have open positions but one is very busy, the other may get started sooner. The other is that in case you fail at one process, you have a clear backup plan communicated to your recruiter through your other applications. However, there are other ways of communicating the same information, such as “just telling them”, or applying to your second choice after you fail the first.\nThere are also downsides of multiple applications in the same company: I have seen hiring managers (not necessarily from the companies I worked at) complaining to me about candidates with many applications: “they don’t know what they want or what they’re good at”. Another downside is that your first process can be one that you’re particularly poorly-suited to. You can fail so bad that you actually don’t qualify to apply for any positions for a period of time.\nIn summary, I would personally suggest that you don’t apply to multiple positions in the same company at the same time, unless you really know what you’re doing.\nIf you are not applying to multiple positions and you have not recently been rejected, we move to the next step."

It’s better to apply to the position and get to the recruiter faster. This may be different if you actually know the hiring manager (e.g., you worked together). In this case, it can work to your benefit to let the hiring manager know that you’re applying, but I would still apply first and let them know afterwards.\nIn most companies, the recruiter and hiring manager can see the results of your past applications and details about your past phone screens and on-site interviews at this point. It’s best to be truthful."

    "text": "Technical Phone Screen\nIf you got here, you’ve got pretty far.\nIn many large companies, the recruiter will offer you some coaching on how to succeed at this stage. Don’t be shy about asking for help at this point. You will also find a lot of resources online to interview. For Amazon, it’s important to know the Leadership Principles. You should also check other sites for interview tips, such as Glassdoor and Blind.\nIn behavioral questions, it’s useful to structure your answer in a way that gives a lot of information to the interviewer in a short amount of time. Amazon prefers a method called STAR, which is described in this web page. I find that method to be useful to when interviewing for other companies as well.\nIf you’re interviewing for a technical position, besides a behavioral question, at this point you will be asked to solve a technical problem. In most cases, this will usually be something equivalent to a Leetcode “hard easy” or “easy medium”. If the position that you’re interviewing for is a senior position, the question may be considerably harder.\nThere are a lot of books and sites talking about how to prepare for a phone screen. The most famous one is Cracking the Code Interview. You should prepare the best you can for the phone screen. You should prepare even more if you see that your phone screen is with the hiring manager.\nIt’s not hard to fail phone screens. I have failed phone screens. I have programmed in SQL for 20+ years, and I have failed SQL phone screens. In a recent phone screen, an interviewer asked about MVC models (Model-View-Controller) and the interviewee answered about NBCs (Naive Bayes’ Classifiers) because the sound quality of the call was not so good. That could have been a disaster, but both interviewer and interviewee realized that something was wrong and recovered.\nIn most processes, the phone screen is pass/recycle/fail, instead of just pass/fail. If you don’t pass but you got close, you may get recycled to the “CV Review” phase of a similar position. When hiring managers are hiring for multiple positions (for example, SDE I and SDE II), if you fail the “higher” phone screen (e.g., SDE II) you can still be recycled for the “lower” (e.g. SDE I) phone screen and proceed to the next phase.\nFinally, hiring managers band together, because hiring managers need a lot of experienced interviewers for the on-site interview. If you barely fail a phone screen with one hiring manager but would have passed the phone screen for a different position with with another hiring manager (that would mean a different position or a lower level position), it’s possible that he will refer you to another hiring manager."

    "text": "On-Site Interview\nIf you get here, you’re very close. At this point, the hiring manager and the recruiter will be excited about your prospects. The recruiter is likely to offer you some help and point you to some interview resources. Be sure to pay attention to the recruiter - they are on your side.\nIn all companies that I have worked for or with, when you get to the on-site interview we are hiring for the company, not for the position. We will bring your potential future internal clients to the loop. We will bring your potential future colleagues to the loop. Your hiring manager will be in the loop. These are likely the people that will work with you day in and day out.\nMost technical interview loops are a combination of behavioral and technical interviews. The balance may vary substantially. You should be prepared for at least 40% of technical interviews, although it could be as much as 80%. The remainder will be about behavioral questions. Remember to follow the STAR method to answer questions. This will serve you well even if you’re not interviewing for Amazon.\nIt is extremely rare for a candidate to ace all interviews in a loop. Don’t be discouraged if you gave less than perfect answers a couple times. The outcome will be decided based on the opinions of all interviewers. In my (long) career, I’ve seen many loops in which the decision to hire was not unanimous and even some cases when the opinion was far from unanimous and the person still got hired and did well. Usually, the opinion of the most senior person in the loop weighs more.\nOffer If you got here, congratulations. We think you’re a good fit and want you to be a bigger part of our lives!\nMost companies have somewhat strict offer ranges for their positions and levels. That’s less true about very high levels (ranges tend to be broad), but very common for lower levels (ranges tend to be narrow). The vast majority of offers will start in the midpoint of that strict range.\nCompanies want to make an offer that a candidate will accept, because they want a candidate they liked to start sooner rather than later. I have heard about “low ball” offers inviting negotiation (especially on Blind), but I have never personally seen one.\nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t negotiate. If you don’t like the offer, you should certainly negotiate. If you don’t like the offer even after the negotiation, it’s time to decline and walk away. I have done this several times in my life and even regretted a few, but in general, it’s for the best.\nThat also doesn’t mean that you should always negotiate. Companies want you to accept offers and be happy you did, so it’s not uncommon for the first offer to be really good. If you are already happy, there’s some risk in negotiating. It’s important to be careful to not be final when negotiating, especially for small amounts. You don’t want to risk painting yourself in a corner for a very small potential gain.\nFor example, if you currently have a total compensation of $160k and are offered $199k (which you secretly love), it would be unproductive to go to a position of “it’s either $203k or I walk away”. That small difference may put you out of the range (e.g., the range may be 160k-200k), and even if you receive a counter of $200k (the maximum that can be offered for that position) you may feel like you have to walk away because your demands have not been met. When walking into a negotiation, know what you want, be firm but flexible. And if you love the first offer, take it. Remember that every week you delay your start can cost you approximately 2% of your first year’s salary: a year has 52 weeks."

Do you sniff it first to make sure it’s not spoiled or drink it outright?\nSniffing tends to be the lower cost solution. It’s an imperfect solution, as maybe you’ll find tomorrow that the milk was spoiled but wasn’t stinky yet. However, if the milk is spoiled and already stinky, sniffing it is a lot less disgusting than taking a sip.\nThe phone screen is a sniff test. It is imperfect, it may be a bad experience, but it has a much lower cost than an interview. Although we occasionally use information from the phone screen in further steps of the hiring process, the main goal of a phone screen is to assess whether a candidate has a chance to pass the on-site interview.\nGiven the potential high costs of a false positive in a phone screen, interviewers that do phone screens tend to be more experienced than the average on-site interviewer. It’s also common for the hiring manager to be a phone screener. A phone screen can sometimes be the hardest interview in the whole process."

In that case, people in the interview panel may be annoyed at the phone screener.\nThere are several other outcomes that won’t be judged as harshly: the candidate fails the interview but just barely, the candidate fails the interview for that position but is a good fit for another, the candidate fails the interview for that position level but can be hired at a lower level. The phone screener won’t get called out on those.\nIt’s a lot harder to see failures when the candidate is rejected at the phone screen interview, as it’s harder to track what happened to the candidate. There are several cases of developers failing a phone screen in a company and being hired (and becoming very successful) in another, sometimes more prestigious, company.\nNote that the incentives are biased towards phone screeners rejecting more candidates than they should. This is a good reason to have phone screen interviewers be more experienced people (who may care less about other people being annoyed at them) or the hiring manager, who would take more risk to hire candidates.\nI have no scientific basis or good data for my next statement, but I think that regardless of the incentives above, phone screens still tend towards having more false negatives, that is, they reject people that would do well."

    "text": "How people fail phone screens\n\nCheating\nOne of the defining characteristics of phone screens is that they are remote. Therefore, it’s easier to cheat on them. The whole interviewing process is grueling, and the benefits of passing are pretty great, so I do understand why people want to cheat. I imagine it even works for some people. When it doesn’t work, however, it’s pretty bad.\n\nAs is widely known, lot of technical interview questions and their answers are available on LeetCode. Some interviewers use LeetCode questions, but adapt them for the phone screen interview, usually with good intentions: adding simplifying conditions to make the question easier and therefore making it possible to complete the question during a phone screen.\nWhen cheating candidates hear the question and search for it in LeetCode, they are usually elated to find the answer and gleefully type it pretending that they’re thinking about it on the spot. However, since the question was adapted, the LeetCode answer doesn’t work, it doesn’t even make any sense: it solves a different, more complex problem than the one being asked.\nAlthough the consequences may vary, they are at best the same as being eliminated by simply failing. If the candidate were to try to answer the question normally, they would probably do much better.\n\n\nLying on their resumes\nIf the position requires SQL or some programming language, you are likely to be asked questions about SQL or that programming during the phone screen. I have seen candidates apply to positions that require SQL, write that they know SQL in their resume, get to the phone screen, and then say that they don’t know SQL when asked basic questions.\nThe rational explanation I can come up with is that these candidates are hoping for a false positive. As bad as the interview process is, it’s more likely to generate false negatives than false positives, and I think a candidate would have better chances playing the lottery.\n\n\nNot talking through their thinking\nThe candidate is asked a question, but actually doesn’t know exactly how to solve it. Maybe they are nervous and forgot not only the syntax but even some concepts. Maybe they aren’t as experienced as their resume led the recruiters to believe.\nBy talking through their thinking, candidates can show that they know something, and would usually get some hints if they’re going in the right direction. However, at least once a quarter I have some candidate that becomes absolutely silent instead of talking through what they’re thinking and eventually gives up. This makes it hard to help these candidates."

The interviews were recorded and the “candidates” and interviewers were told that the recordings would be shown to students and some of their colleagues.

The “candidates” were senior developers and they had seen the answer minutes before. Regardless, 3 of them (60%) couldn’t complete the question in 20 minutes with hints. The remaining 2 “candidates” needed hints to finish. All of them missed some key detail.\nRegardless, they would all pass a phone screen."

They check with the interviewer if their understanding, assumptions and strategy make sense. It is easier to fix problems in the beginning rather than after they start coding.\n\n\nThey are organized\nWhile I understand a candidate will be very nervous during a phone screen and that is likely going to make it harder for them to organize their thinking, I think the strategies below will help them calm down and still be able to organize their thinking.\n\nThey comment their code: I wish I saw more comments in production. Of course, I wish I saw more comments in interviews. These comments may help you structure your thinking better and not forget things.\nThey use meaningful function and variable names: I wish I saw more meaningful names in production code. Of course, I wish I saw more meaningful names in interviews. This will help you remember what your code is supposed to do, and it will also help the interviewer understand what you’re trying to do and help you.\n\n\n\nThey don’t try to show perfection during the phone screen\nI always try to tell my candidates that I don’t expect perfection, using different words. Although perfection may happen - I see it about once a year - most candidates will not get the answers completely correct. They will forget some condition, have some syntax problem, provide a solution that is not optimal. That’s usually ok.\nTrying to be perfect is likely to make candidates focus on the wrong things during the interview and get nervous if they can’t be perfect at that time, which will in turn prevent them from showing a lot of things that they’re perfectly good at."

Getting promoted is a good thing: it will give you a better salary and sometimes an expanded scope that will allow you to have opportunities to grow even further.\nI had many career conversations in my tenure, and in a large proportion of cases, “getting promoted on the job I currently hold” is not a typical lifelong objective, but it’s typically an objective that people have a plan for. On the other hand, people frequently tell me about major goals/objectives (change professions, open their own company, get a Ph.D., etc.) for which they don’t have an action plan.\nIt’s like their algorithm is stuck near a local maxima (in this text, optimizing will mean maximizing) and the only thing they can see is the short-term objective, so they can only trace paths to get to the local maxima.\n\nEventually, people reach a local maxima and realize it’s not their global objective. They may not know what their global objective is, they just know “it’s not this”. Interestingly, the way that people solve that problem is not that different from what an algorithm would do if it realized it got stuck in a local maxima: take a big step, and start again from someplace else."

    "text": "THe multi-armed bandit\nThe hardest problem to solve in career optimization is lack of information. People may have some general idea of where they want to go, but usually not much. For example, I commonly hear people saying that they want to become managers, but after just a few questions I realize that they don’t really know what that means and whether they actually want that.\nOne way to maximize happiness under incomplete information is to explore several different things, and once you find what makes you happy, then you exploit it (although “exploit” is a somewhat aggressive word in English, it’s actually the technical term), getting as much happiness as you can from it. There are algorithms to find a good balance between exploration and exploitation. One example is the “multi-armed bandit”.\nThe concept comes from slot machines in casinos. Because a slot machine has one lever that people pull to activate it and people usually lose money on it, it’s called an “one-armed bandit”.\nImagine a slot machine that has multiple levers, therefore a “multi-armed bandit”. When pulled, each lever gives a prize based on a statistical distribution that is unknown to the player. You pull the first lever and get $100. Should you pull the same lever again or switch? Maybe one of the other levers has a constant payoff of $1,000. Maybe that lever you just pulled is actually the best one.\nWithout knowing the distributions, you can’t know the optimal action to take. In real life, not only one doesn’t know the distributions, but the distributions for each lever can change over time. If that was not complicated enough, you also have infinite levers to choose from. Nobody said it was supposed to be easy.\n\nThe multi-armed bandit problem doesn’t have a general optimal solution, but has several strategies that achieve approximate solutions. It is a classical reinforcement learning problem.\nMany strategies are very simple “epsilon” strategies, for which one decides a proportion epsilon (between 0 and 1) of exploration (trying to figure out the distributions of the available actions), and the remainder of the time is used for exploitation (performing the action that is expected to yield the best results).\nIn career conversations, I always suggest that people take the time to explore new things, especially things that are in the (conceptual) neighborhood of what they think they want. Because I’m older than the average tech person, they may think this is some form of ancient wisdom, but I’m just pointing them towards a classical (and somewhat modern) reinforcement learning algorithm.\nThat’s using data science in production."

The also common and more dangerous version is asking “how can I do X” and omitting “to solve Y”.\nFor example, let’s say Jay urgently needs to get some data that exists in a database. Jay recently used pandas in Jupyter for a different project and decides to ask “How can I connect a Jupyter notebook to the corporate database?” (omitting the reason why). What Jay doesn’t is that a report already exists.\nPeople spend time helping Jay. Jay spends time getting permissions, installing and configuring packages, etc. to solve a problem that was already solved.\nState the problem you’re trying to solve, rather than asking for help with a specific task.

Azure Functions can normally run in two modes: “Consumption” and “Dedicated”. Consumption is virtually free, but the “dedicated” mode costs approximately $35 per month for the cheapest version. According to the README the “Consumption” mode is upcoming, and I have a small allowance due to my MSDN subscription, so I caved.\n\nAnd there goes objective #2. But it seems temporary, so we’re probably good.\n\n\nDeveloping a Slack Bot\nA Slack bot is essentially an HTTP server that will receive JSONs and perform actions through HTTP requests. Azure Functions have an HTTP Trigger template, so this takes care of most of the plumbing. I created a Slack app using the instructions here. This bot subscribes to events, which are sent to an URL. I’ve created the HTTP Server that provides that URL using the instructions on how to create a function using the command line interface, and creating a sample based on the HttpTrigger.\nSpecifically, my Azure Function receives JSONs for each message, parses them to see if they have a :stroopwafel:, and if they do, parses the mentions (@user) in the message. For each mention, we log a :stroopwafel: gift in a database, from which we can build reports at the end of a period.\n\n\nPyODBC\nThe original idea was tha whenever a message mentioned a :stroopwafel:, the bot would use pyodbc to save the message in a database. Databases are usually not free, but Azure offers SQL Server for as low as $5 per month, and that seemed acceptable. The problem is that pyodbc does not have a linux wheel, and currently Azure Functions for Linux requires wheels. There’s a way of compiling the package on the fly, but it currently has a bug. And I don’t know how long it will take to fix that bug.\nI searched for alternatives to PyODBC, and the best alternative was to use Cosmos DB, since its Python package pydocumentdb has a wheel. The downside is that the cheapest Cosmos DB plan as of this writing costs $25. And now we’re far away from objective #2, and we’re also not doing great with objective #4. However, I found Cosmos DB a pleasure to use.\n\n\nGitHub\nOnce I was done with my development, which Azure Functions Core Tools made really convenient by setting a local test server whenever I run func host start, I pushed my repository to GitHub and configured the Azure Function app to consume it using Continuous Deployment, which is something that you can set up in Azure with just a few clicks. However, it doesn’t yet work (sad trombone). Luckily, deploying without GitHub is not that bad. Again, Azure Functions Core Tools provides a command-line interface utility that pushes your application to the server: func azure functionapp publish <app-name>, and you’re done in a couple of minutes. But I also don’t fulfill objective #5."

It does a lot of the hard work for you, and if you’re familiar with one of the many languages available, you can deploy your program to production really fast. I had never developed a Slack bot before, and I’ve started the bot during a sleepless night and finished it in an afternoon. All in, it took me less than two days of work to get an app to production. There are still some kinks to be worked out but Azure Functions v2 has already proved to be useful to me.\nI wrote about Azure Functions before, specifically about using Python in Azure Functions v1. Azure Functions can be very useful for Data Scientists: it’s an easy way to deploy a model to production, perform scheduled maintenance, update datasets on a schedule, etc. With v2, Python became a first class player. I’m sure I’ll use it a lot."

Of course, measuring things is tricky, and an art that we #DataScientists are (or at least should be) very familiar with. Measuring things differently, Seattle has around 150 “sunny days” per year, and Miami has around 250. That’s almost three months less.\nMeasuring things in yet another way, the average number of hours of sunlight in Seattle per year is approximately 2,000. Miami and LA get approximately 3,200. Las Vegas gets 3,800. Besides being cloudy and rainy, Seattle is further to the north, and the sun sets before 5 PM for a large part of the winter.\nI find that the lack of sunlight gets to me a lot more than the rain and the temperature, both of which I actually enjoy.\nOne trick I learned is to use “corn cob lightbulbs” everywhere in my house. A 50W corn cob bulb produces 5,000 lumens. A typical 13W CFL light produces about 1,000 lumens, the same as a 60W incandescent light. After installing corn cob lightbulbs in my office, I started feeling a lot less tired after a long day of #wfh during the winter, even finding energy to cook and play board games with my kids.\nIf you’re considering to move to Seattle, it’s not about the umbrellas. It rarely rains hard enough to justify using one. It’s more about finding a way of being outside when there’s sunlight (and there are plenty of great things to do around Seattle what that’s the case) and getting enough illumination when one can’t go out."

When they do well, they are sometimes asked to try out management.\nManager performance is usually measured by a combination of team output and HR-related metrics for the team such as job satisfaction, manager satisfaction, retention, etc. It’s hard to achieve optimal output if the HR metrics are suffering.\nUnsurprisingly, the skills to perform well as an IC and the skills to perform well as a manager are different. Perversely, high-performance ICs that become manager have a handicap: they are usually a lot faster than their (new) direct reports. Instead of trying to develop and apply team management skills, these new managers sometimes take over work from their team members, preventing learning and growing, frustrating people and reducing the team’s effectiveness."

In addition to 1:1s, managers also spend time talking to a whole lot of other people: their own managers, clients (internal and/or external), partner teams, suppliers, HR, Finance, recruiting. They also represent their team in planning meetings and review meetings. All those conversations add up, as it can be seen in a sample manager calendar below, in which all purple meetings are conversations with other people.\n\nWith that much pressure on their calendars, it’s no surprise that managers give a lot of value to meeting efficiency. One of my favorite books on the topic is The Surprising Science of Meetings. Managers also need to be very efficient with their own time, which brings us to our next topic."

Experienced managers develop large and deep networks, both internally and externally.\nThe external network allows managers to recruit external candidates more quickly and to keep a pulse in the job market. The internal network is important for several reasons: the first and more obvious is to find internal candidates, which tend to require less ramp-up.\nA second reason is that a lot of a team’s work depends on other teams. One way to develop these internal networks is to help fellow managers hire: experienced interviewers are always in demand. A final, but important reason: managers occasionally find themselves on the other side of the interview table, and having a good networks helps finding good seats."

Different teams will have access to different tools and methodologies. Like the old adage “failing to plan is planning to fail”, having a process and tool is usually far better than having none.\nA consistent process will outlive tools.

Experience with managerial tasks, or “seat time” matters a lot for success as a manager, but once one moves to a management position, lot of time that could be spent learning technologies and techniques will be consumed by meetings, recruiting and commitment tracking.\nMove into management too early and one’s experience may have to rely more on “seat time” instead of “tech depth”. Take too long to move and one may have enough “tech depth” to be frustrated at their team members lack of expertise, and may not have the “seat time” required to be an efficient manager for them.\n\nIt’s not all unicorns and rainbows, but there’s a lot of good\nI found that I derive a lot more pleasure at telling somebody that they got the job that they applied for than from getting a new job myself. A similar thing happened when telling somebody that they got a promotion. And when somebody’s article got accepted to a conference. And in many other similar things.\nI found that I enjoyed helping others succeed through early experiences with mentorship, before I became a manager. Being a manager is living vicariously and enjoying it. It’s not that I don’t enjoy being personally successful, but being a part of great teams and helping them succeed brought me more happiness than I think I could have found on my own.\nWhen you feel the same, it’s worth it trying it out."

    "text": "A new data scientist had just started working on the collections team for a large company. One of the problems they wanted to solve was “does contacting customers help at all?”\nIt’s an important question. After all, the cost of collections is directly related to the number of contacts. The more contacts, the more people.\nThe DS had a table with of invoices and payment dates, and a table with a history of contacts by invoice. Using the invoice issue date and invoice payment date, he created a payment delay metric. Then, he joined the contact history and created a metric for number of contacts. Finally, he calculated the correlation between the number of contacts and payment delay.\nHe was startled by the results: the more contacts per invoice, the longer it took customers to pay.\nHe told the collections manager, who got very excited. He long suspected that the contact center had too many people. Now he had some proof.\nThe DS carefully separated the data in a training and a test sample, and trained a regression model using XGBoost. Given inputs such as the invoice country and amount, the model predicted the delay in days given an estimated number of contacts. The model had a very low error (<0.5d) in the training dataset. When using the unseen test dataset, the error was also minimal.\nThe DS and the collections manager made a plan to deploy a tool to collectors. When assigned an invoice, collectors should enter the characteristics of the invoice in the tool and add 1 contact. For example, if a collector was assigned an invoice with 10 days delay and 2 contacts, they should enter 3 as the number of contacts. If the model returned a number larger than the current delay, the collector should not make the contact. They should just wait.\nOnce the tool was deployed, the number of contacts initially dropped a lot. To the collections manager surprise, however, the payment delays also increased. Customers were paying much later than usual, and ended up having to be contacted anyway.\nAs you may already have realized, the problem with the idea was that customers were not delaying because they were annoyed with too many contacts. The relation went in the other direction: customers were being contacted because they were late. While contacts and lateness was very correlated, lateness caused contacts, not the other way around.\nThe project was scrapped. The team decided that data science was all hype. The data scientist moved on to another team. The collections team went back to the old way of contacting customers: about once per week until they paid.\nIt took a while (and a new data scientist) for that team to trust data science again: a few years later, a new data scientist started experimenting with assigning different strategies to randomized customers, and that improved collections a lot. But that’s another tale."

Some of the other teams had prep meetings, of which both me and my direct could (and did) participate. I couldn’t be on the big meeting to align on the roadmap, but it was well-supported and felt like everything was under control. Other members of my team would also attend to provide details about their projects, and they were well-prepared.\nOn the day of the meeting, which was also the first day of my long-awaited vacations, I was packed and ready to leave for my trip when I got a notice that my flight was delayed. I was planning to leave home a little after 9 AM, but now I could safely leave 10:30 AM and still arrive comfortably at the airport. Staying home longer would even mean less traffic to the airport.\nWith time to spare, I decided to join the meeting, even though I was a little late.

Since I could join and didn’t want to miss the meeting, I joined”.\nSurprisingly directly and publicly, my friend on the meeting said: “Nah, you should log off.

I said: “You’re right, sorry for the disruption, I’m the least prepared for this meeting since I wasn’t planning to attend, and I’m sure I’ll be updated when I get back, I’ll drop off now”, got a bunch of “Have a good vacation” and disconnected.\nIn addition to showing that “vacations are important”, I also had the opportunity to show that “being wrong is ok”. Nobody was shutting me out. When I came back, I took over that workstream and ran it to the end. I was just making it harder for my team to help me by showing that I could help myself. Besides, we were just being fiercely protective of the work/life balance that we worked so hard to achieve on that group.\nI didn’t realize the message I was sending, and I was glad to be called out."
