    "section": "",
    "text": "Florida has nice weather most of the time, but also has extreme weather occasionally.\nHurricane Irma happened when I was out on a business trip, and my family was in Parkland, FL. Forecasts went from “maybe it will hit you” to “if you stay you’ll surely die” to “I think it’s not going to hit you anymore” to “Phew, it will miss” in four days.\nWe did a lot of preparation using conditional probabilities. In our assessment, it would be very unlikely for the hurricane to hit both the East and West coast. So we decided to move the family from Parkland, FL to Tampa (back then, the hurricane was forecasted to hit the East coast), but to book hotels in both Pensacola (Florida panhandle) and Jacksonville, FL while we waited for new forecasts.\nAs days went by, the forecasts moved further and further West. On Saturday 2 AM, the forecast was that the hurricane would hit Tampa as a Category 4, so staying there was too risky. And then we had to decide between moving to the Florida panhandle, moving to Jacksonville and incredibly, going back to Parkland, near Fort Lauderdale.\nThe uncertainty seemed higher for places that were north of Tampa: it was hard to tell whether the hurricane would turn either way in 3 days. On the other hand, the forecasts are better in close proximity to the hurricane, and it seemed pretty certain that the hurricane would miss the Parkland/Boca Raton area. So we made the somewhat gutsy call that my wife would come back to Parkland with the kids.\nThere’s surely an element of luck to all of this, but the outcome was positive. We had very minor damage in our house: a couple plants and a downspout. I think the total amount of damage is going to be less than $100. It’s hard to be precise because there may be damage that is hard to see, like on the roof. We did not lose power, internet or even satellite TV. The hardest part was the stress.\nOn Monday morning the winds were back to normal. There’s still a lot of debris around the county. I’m supposed to fly back home tomorrow, if the airport opens, and hopefully I’ll be able to get a ride home. This was more of a suspense than a horror movie. Many people were not as lucky as we were and we’ll now see how we can help them."

    "title": "Lenovo P51 - the Data Scientist’s laptop",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, as part of a computer refresh, I have moved from a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 to a Lenovo P51.\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 3 was the right computer for me at the time I got it, but as time went by my position changed substantially, and it ceased to be appropriate for me.\nWhen I got the Surface, the core of my work consisted in traveling, having conference calls and light emailing and spreadsheet work. As time went by, my work went back to creating analytics, creating presentations about analytics, and traveling. There is where the screen of the Surface becomes a liability at 12 inches. I wanted something bigger.\nAnd boy, is the P51 bigger. It has a 15-inch screen and a power brick that alone is twice as heavy as the Surface Pro. It’s big enough to have a keyboard that comes with a numeric keypad. Since I still have to travel a lot, I chose the P51 over the beefier 17-inch P71. The P71 won’t even fit in my somewhat large Osprey backpack. The P51 barely fits.\nDue to some standardization constraints, my P51 is the 1920x1080 version with touch screen. It has 32 Gb of RAM and a 500 Gb SSD. It has the i7 7820HQ running at 2.9 GHz and a Quadro M2200 GPU. If I had the option, I’d choose the 4K screen and the Xeon processor, but I did not have that option.\nThe battery life is surprisingly good. For the kind of things that I do in planes (writing blog posts, editing presentations, light programming), the battery seems to last well over 8h without Wi-Fi and about 7h with Wi-Fi. I have yet to run out of battery in a flight. I have read that the earlier version of the P51, the P50, would trip the circuit breaker of a plane if you tried to plug it in. I have not attempted to plug in the P51 yet.\nThe P51 is usable in the Premium Economy seats and, of course, in business and first class seats, but I have the impression that it would not fit well in the economy class of carriers that have a very small distance between seats (like American Airlines domestic flights), especially if the person in front of you reclines their seat. It works well in exit seats.\nOne gripe I had about the Surface Pro 3 was that I always had to travel with a USB hub, a mouse, and a couple mini-DisplayPort adapters. The P51 comes with a mechanical keyboard, the beloved TrackPoint, a good TouchPad, 4 USB ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, an Ethernet port, an HDMI port, and, to my surprise, a mini-DisplayPort, so I get to keep all the adapters I had for the Surface.\nI’ve also considered the P51-S. The slimmer version trades off some power (it goes from quad-core to dual-core) for a thinner, lighter frame. I think the P51-S would also have been a solid choice, but I think it would force me to do most of my work from a workstation and/or a server that I’d need to remote into frequently, adding to the stress of versioning and synchronizing. Somewhat counter-intuitively, I chose the heavier computer because I travel a lot, as it has enough power for me to do the vast majority of my work on it and use a server or workstation just for the realhardcore stuff.\nIn summary, the Lenovo P51 is a great computer for the traveling data scientist. It’s powerful enough to be used as your primary machine. For me, it’s near the top limit of a computer that is comfortable to travel with, but still within that limit. I got used to it in no time and completely gave up my desktop workstation."

    "text": "Should data science teams be centralized or distributed?\nI was happy to find that Jonathan Nolis has the same opinion as I do: that a data science team works best when distributed into client areas. In addition, we agree that if you distribute your data science team among several different client areas, you have to find a way of keeping the data scientists feeling as if they’re part of a cohesive group. And that’s hard.\nFor me, a key part of the argument to distribute data scientists in client areas relies on Drew Conway’s (ancient) Data Science Venn diagram.\n\n\n\nData Science Venn Diagram\n\n\nAssigning data scientists to a client area will help build the “Substantive Expertise” part of the diagram. A common trap here is “Well, we can do the same if we keep the data scientists centralized and give them specializations that match the client areas.”\nAlthough I think that can work, I worry about what happens when data scientists have downtime.\n\nIncentives for client areas and centralized data science teams\nIn my observations (low sample size), the client areas usually have a better sense of ROI1 - if they invest resources on something, they expect returns. On the other hand, most centralized data science teams I’ve seen have two problems: data scientists hired without a clear purpose and an incentive to overengineering: a current example is to use Deep Learning where a regression would do.\n\n\n\nOverengineering\n\n\nIt may be simply that client areas are more mature and battle worn than centralized data science groups, at least in my experience. I think that if a data scientist is assigned to a client area and there’s downtime, they’ll put the data scientist to work in business intelligence or decision analysis. On the other hand, if the data scientist is assigned to a centralized data science group, they’ll be pulled into a project away from their “client area specialization” or will find a way to work in something novel that’s cool (as of 2018, autoencoders, GANs or something with “Bayesian” in its name).\nAnd here the ROI appears again: as the data scientist works through the BI project, they’ll learn more about the data and more about the business and its data, and that investment has a large likelihood of return in their next project in the same group. Whereas if they spend this time learning a new technique, the return is uncertain.\n\n\nBut wait, if you do that, data scientists will never learn something new\nHere’s where the hard part of keeping a data scientist community pays off. That community may be weekly “Lunch & Learns” if the number of data scientists is small, or quarterly conferences if the number of data scientists is very big and your company is very, very rich.\nIf you don’t forcefully push towards having such a community, it’s very likely that data scientists will reinvent the wheel over and over again, and if their time is as precious as their high salary indicates, that will be a waste of money. For example, if you have 5 data scientists It’s better to spend $50k on travel to bring them together a few times a year than to have one of them wasting three months reinventing something that another of them already done.\n\n\nWhere I disagree with Jonathan Nolis\nIn the podcast, Jonathan suggests that the data scientists should be assigned to client areas and report “solid line” to a Chief Data Scientist, while reporting “dotted line” to the client areas. I would do the opposite. However, listening to the podcast, it seems that Jonathan didn’t have a strong opinion that one is better than the other, and again in agreement, neither do I.\nOne big advantage of having a “solid line” group of data scientists is career advancement. It’s easier to compare data scientists with other data scientists. Leaving them in the client areas will require to compare them with other members of the client area, and they may be seen as wizards (and overvalued) or “too hard to understand”, and be undervalued.\nOne disadvantage is estimating the value of the data scientist to the client area. Data scientists that are more creative in their value calculations or less scrupulous are probably going to get ahead. I’ve lost count of the times that a data science project saved more revenue than the customer ever had.\n\n\nSo, what do I do?\nHonestly, if you’re starting a data science team, your best bet is to hire someone like Jonathan or Drew Conway to plan the team for you. You’re going to spend a lot of money on Data Science, and it’s important to make sure that it will be well spent.\nIf you’re on a budget and all you can invest is the time to read some blog posts, well… you probably don’t have enough money to hire data scientists. But if you do, I recommend assigning them to the client areas and keeping them there. Even when they’re not doing modeling or machine learning, they’re learning more about the business and its data."

    "text": "Should we care?\nThere’s a lot of information asymmetry in the Data Science market, the position being so new, and “Michael Spence signaling” matters. Having a “Data Scientist” title from a reputable company is an important signal. For example, a medium-sized company might not be aware that Lyft recently changed their data analysts title to “Data Scientist”\nPart of the problem is that the “Data Scientist” title is itself poorly defined, as shown by the litany of Venn and not-Venn diagrams listed above. A short, non-comprehensive list of alternative titles for Data Scientists I’ve met in the last month:\n\nTableau/Power BI Report Designer\nMachine Learning Researcher\nPython Programmer who knows how to call scikit-learn functions\n\nUsing the same name for vastly different abilities makes matching between employers and employees difficult. In addition, it may make career progression difficult. For example, job responsibilities and objectives are likely to be related to a company’s interpretation of the title of “Data Scientist”. Employees in that company may be “Data Scientists” under other interpretations, and may be really good, but may have their performance evaluated under different guidelines: “I know your ML model saved $1B for our company, but the color scheme of your Tableau reports is horrible!” As per the (not really) Albert Einstein’s quote “(…) if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”"

    "text": "Conway’s Venn to the rescue!\nHere’s where I think Conway’s Venn diagram comes to the rescue in a useful way. We could rule out the Tableau Designer if they lack programming or statistical skills. We could rule out the ML Researcher if they don’t have domain expertise. We could rule out the Python programmer if they don’t know Math and/or have domain expertise. Perhaps this makes Data Scientists hard to find (it would justify their salary)!\nDepending what the company you work for was before the Data Science profession started, a lot of people from different jobs may have re-branded themselves as data scientists. I think Conway’s diagram is helpful as it points to where people should focus their development in order to be more effective as data scientists. For example, former Economists most likely need more hacking skills, former computer scientists need more Statistics and domain expertise, and former management/technical consultants likely need more Statistics.\nIt can also serve as a check for inclusiveness. For example, a team of former machine learning engineers is struggling to deliver meaningful projects because they lack domain expertise. However, they can’t hire domain experts because the domain experts keep failing the machine learning interviews. Comically, the machine learning engineers think that domain expertise “is easy”.\n\n\n\nEverything you don’t know is easy\n\n\nThe most useful part of Conway’s diagram for me is that I’ve time and again observed projects that don’t have representatives that can communicate well with each other in all three areas to fail. Conway’s diagram even makes it easy to show how the project failed (“nobody with domain expertise”, “missing knowledge of statistics”). Having a single person that can do all three is difficult, but it certainly solves the communication problem. That being hard or impossible, having specialists that can communicate with each other will usually be sufficient."

In my experience, one of the things that I usually miss is “intensity”. Someone that knows how to write a “Hello World!”, knows how to take averages, and know how to calculate compound interest has knowledge in all three areas of the Venn diagram, but is probably not the ideal person to lead a data science project in Finance. Conway’s is best used to tell you what’s missing for career development, for a team, for a project, but it will not solve all problems.\nIt will, however, solve many problems that matter, and will provide useful information very elegantly. You can’t ask much more from a model."

    "text": "Azure Functions v2\nMicrosoft recently released a Python worker for the Azure Functions runtime v2. As of this writing (2018-08-23), both Azure Functions v2 and the python worker are in “preview mode”. The Azure Functions v1 runtime supports development and hosting only in the portal or on Windows. The v2 runtime runs on .NET Core, and therefore can run on Windows, macOS and Linux. Microsoft provides a set of tools based on Node.JS and .NET Core that make it easy to develop in any platform. That takes care of objectives #1, #3 and #6. Although knocking off three objectives simply by selecting Azure Functions v2 sounded very promising to begin with, that’s as many objectives as I could achieve.\n\nLinux host\nRegardless of the platform you develop on, Python function apps need to be hosted on Azure Functions on Linux. Running on Linux has a couple downsides:\n\nYou have to access the Azure Portal using a secret code to enable Azure to offer Linux hosts\nAs of this writing (2018-08-23), Linux hosts can only be dedicated. Azure Functions can normally run in two modes: “Consumption” and “Dedicated”. Consumption is virtually free, but the “dedicated” mode costs approximately $35 per month for the cheapest version. According to the README the “Consumption” mode is upcoming, and I have a small allowance due to my MSDN subscription, so I caved.\n\nAnd there goes objective #2. But it seems temporary, so we’re probably good.\n\n\nDeveloping a Slack Bot\nA Slack bot is essentially an HTTP server that will receive JSONs and perform actions through HTTP requests. Azure Functions have an HTTP Trigger template, so this takes care of most of the plumbing. I created a Slack app using the instructions here. This bot subscribes to events, which are sent to an URL. I’ve created the HTTP Server that provides that URL using the instructions on how to create a function using the command line interface, and creating a sample based on the HttpTrigger.\nSpecifically, my Azure Function receives JSONs for each message, parses them to see if they have a :stroopwafel:, and if they do, parses the mentions (@user) in the message. For each mention, we log a :stroopwafel: gift in a database, from which we can build reports at the end of a period.\n\n\nPyODBC\nThe original idea was tha whenever a message mentioned a :stroopwafel:, the bot would use pyodbc to save the message in a database. Databases are usually not free, but Azure offers SQL Server for as low as $5 per month, and that seemed acceptable. The problem is that pyodbc does not have a linux wheel, and currently Azure Functions for Linux requires wheels. There’s a way of compiling the package on the fly, but it currently has a bug. And I don’t know how long it will take to fix that bug.\nI searched for alternatives to PyODBC, and the best alternative was to use Cosmos DB, since its Python package pydocumentdb has a wheel. The downside is that the cheapest Cosmos DB plan as of this writing costs $25. And now we’re far away from objective #2, and we’re also not doing great with objective #4. However, I found Cosmos DB a pleasure to use.\n\n\nGitHub\nOnce I was done with my development, which Azure Functions Core Tools made really convenient by setting a local test server whenever I run func host start, I pushed my repository to GitHub and configured the Azure Function app to consume it using Continuous Deployment, which is something that you can set up in Azure with just a few clicks. However, it doesn’t yet work (sad trombone). Luckily, deploying without GitHub is not that bad. Again, Azure Functions Core Tools provides a command-line interface utility that pushes your application to the server: func azure functionapp publish <app-name>, and you’re done in a couple of minutes. But I also don’t fulfill objective #5."

It does a lot of the hard work for you, and if you’re familiar with one of the many languages available, you can deploy your program to production really fast. I had never developed a Slack bot before, and I’ve started the bot during a sleepless night and finished it in an afternoon. All in, it took me less than two days of work to get an app to production. There are still some kinks to be worked out but Azure Functions v2 has already proved to be useful to me.\nI wrote about Azure Functions before, specifically about using Python in Azure Functions v1. Azure Functions can be very useful for Data Scientists: it’s an easy way to deploy a model to production, perform scheduled maintenance, update datasets on a schedule, etc. With v2, Python became a first class player. I’m sure I’ll use it a lot."

I can’t remember any software that I was ever unable to use in Windows: LaTeX, git, Inkscape… everything I need had a decent Windows version, even if I had to compile it from source.\nWeirdly, because I can do so much with Windows, I find that I take too many shortcuts. The most damaging shortcuts are the ones that damage reproducibility, especially when creating documentation for my projects. It’s too easy to copy and paste into PowerPoint and be done with the communications for a talk. Some of my talks, especially about my most successful product, have many similar versions with one or two slides changed. Someone asks me for a slightly shorter or slightly longer talk and I suddenly have a new file with one or two extra (or hidden) slides that I may need to maintain.

    "text": "Why Arch\nI first got into contact with Arch through a German friend back in 2010. When trying to install it, I quickly learned that Arch requires you to understand what you’re doing, and especially, that if you don’t understand what you’re doing, things break. Over time, I found that although some things have a steep learning curve, the return on the time investment was very positive. I also tried Ubuntu, Fedora and Red Hat, and although I could get productive more quickly, keeping them configured to my taste later was harder - when something broke it took me longer to understand what it was.\nThere are several things that still don’t work well in Linux. One of the most vexing is having a high-DPI display. It’s somewhat hard to configure it. It works well in KDE, but KDE has tearing issues. It doesn’t work too well in GNOME unless you use Wayland, which brings a host of different issues. You can make everything a lot worse by using the NVidia proprietary driver with Wayland, but it’s needed if you want to use the GPU efficiently.\nSo although I managed to configure my Arch installation to use GNOME under Wayland and use the NVidia proprietary driver, it’s very unstable. Native applications tend to run, but many applications crash in comical ways: resizing Google Chrome under Wayland is a sure way to cause a crash, for example."

It may also result in wider than optimal adoption, which will require extra support, also detracting to high-quality data science work. Perhaps it pays better, but higher-quality also generally pays better than lower-quality, so it’s not that simple.\nOf course, I wish my work was such high-quality that this was the real problem. The likely explanation is that I rather work with models than sell them."

I think that the most important idea from that post is actually from a presentation he gave. Here’s the key idea, as reported by Amelia McNamara:\nIn summary, things that you keep to yourself have very little value, and things that you share with the world have a lot of value. I think that’s a very cool idea for the Economics of information. For an extreme case, imagine you have a trade secret that allows you to solve a specific class of problems faster than others. In this case, it’s understandable that you want to keep the trade secret to yourself. But it makes sense to advertise to the world that you can quickly solve some kinds problems faster than others. That makes your trade secret more valuable."

    "text": "The discipline of writing about what you’re doing\nWhen I was a wee little kid and had just entered college, one of my first classes was “Physics Lab”, and the first class of that was to measure “gravity”, more specifically, the gravitational acceleration . Of course, mathy Computer Science studies that we were, we all knew that the gravitational acceleration would be \\(g \\approx 9.8 m/s^2\\).\nMeasuring it, however, it’s not very easy. First, remember that this is in the early 90s in Brazil, so digital cameras were very rare. Part of the problem is that 9.8 meters (approximately 30 feet) is quite high, so if we wanted our experiment to take around 1s, we would need a big ladder. Or, as it happened, we’d need to run an experiment that took less than a second for each run. In a class with 25 students, that was the preferred route.\nWe set up a vertical track attached to a device that would spark every 1/60 of a second, and we attached grid paper to the track. This is called a Behr free fall apparatus.\nWe would release the device from the top of the track, and the sparks would mark the grid paper. We would then manually measure the distances between the sparks and the differences between the distances would tell us the acceleration. In theory. Again, remember this is the early 90s, so there’s no Windows 95 or Excel easily available, there were several steps that were prone to error.\nThe desired outcome was not only to calculate the acceleration due to gravity, but also to generate a lab report."

Oh boy. We quickly found out that the best lab reports were the ones in which the experimenter would document the experiment as they were executing the experiment. Another thing that worked was going through the experiment more than once. What did not work was to perform the experiment and then go to where the computers were to type up a report from memory.\nI thought that was very insightful, shortly afterwards, we would learn about Donald Knuth’s proposed paradigm of literate programming, which lives on in Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown and that is very popular in data science today. Behind it is the same concept of explanations interspersed with technical work to produce something that is reproducible and easy to understand."

David argues that aspiring data scientists should blog for technical practice, to build a portfolio, and to get feedback. Experienced data scientists might benefit for similar reasons, but not exactly the same.\nSimilar to “practicing”, blogging about technical topics helps you learn how to communicate better about them, and also helps you learn how to write better research reports. Similar to “portfolio”, it signals a data scientist’s body of work. For an early-in-career data scientist, it may be more showing that you can do analysis, but for an experienced data scientist is more about what type of analysis you like to do. Finally, I think that “feedback” also works differently for early-in-career and experienced data scientists. I’m not sure random strangers in the internet will sweep in and correct your posts, but you can find out what people are reading and sharing. You may be surprised when you learn what parts of your work people find interesting."

Some positions are more restricted, for example, requiring a specific city.\nPeople without the basic qualifications. In many companies, positions will have both basic and preferred qualifications listed. Read them - if you meet the basic qualifications, you’re fine.

    "text": "Deduplication\nOnce you apply to a position, the first group that sees your position is the recruiting team. You should not be surprised that their goal is the same as the hiring manager’s: they want to get to the “offer accepted” stage.\nThe first thing they do is to check if you’re not already in an active process with another recruiter. If you are, they’re going to let that process finish first, and you would probably be better served by waiting until that process ends before applying.\nRecruiters manage multiple positions and hundreds of candidates, and it’s hard to keep track of complex details for everyone, such as when to contact you back in case you fail one of your 20 attempts. Recruiters do an incredibly good job of keeping track of candidates, and succeed at superhuman levels, but you can help yourself by focusing on one position at a time.\nI am not sure whether applying to multiple positions in the same company simultaneously works well. One advantage is that it may get you started early - if two teams have open positions but one is very busy, the other may get started sooner. The other is that in case you fail at one process, you have a clear backup plan communicated to your recruiter through your other applications. However, there are other ways of communicating the same information, such as “just telling them”, or applying to your second choice after you fail the first.\nThere are also downsides of multiple applications in the same company: I have seen hiring managers (not necessarily from the companies I worked at) complaining to me about candidates with many applications: “they don’t know what they want or what they’re good at”. Another downside is that your first process can be one that you’re particularly poorly-suited to. You can fail so bad that you actually don’t qualify to apply for any positions for a period of time.\nIn summary, I would personally suggest that you don’t apply to multiple positions in the same company at the same time, unless you really know what you’re doing.\nIf you are not applying to multiple positions and you have not recently been rejected, we move to the next step."

If it does, the recruiter will likely also “stack rank” your CV against the CVs of other candidates that are already in the process. Remember, the goal is to get a candidate to “offer accepted”.\nFor example, if you have a really strong CV that exceeds all the basic and preferred qualifications and is also better than all other candidates at this point, you’ll likely move to the phone screen phase right away. On the other hand, if there is already a large number of candidates in further stages and your CV barely meets the basic qualifications, you’ll probably sit in a queue for a while.\n\nIf you ask for the hiring manager to review your CV and wait for their response before applying, you may be losing valuable time.\n\n\n \n\nIn large companies, there’s no way for the hiring manager to know how your CV stacks compared to all the other applicants, as many applicants are people who didn’t get selected for other positions (those are sometimes called “recycled applications”), or people who applied through channels other than LinkedIn. These are initially seen only by the recruiters.\nWhen you ask for the hiring manager to review your CV, they usually cannot do a better job than the recruiter would have done. It’s better to apply to the position and get to the recruiter faster. This may be different if you actually know the hiring manager (e.g., you worked together). In this case, it can work to your benefit to let the hiring manager know that you’re applying, but I would still apply first and let them know afterwards.\nIn most companies, the recruiter and hiring manager can see the results of your past applications and details about your past phone screens and on-site interviews at this point. It’s best to be truthful."

    "text": "Technical Phone Screen\nIf you got here, you’ve got pretty far.\nIn many large companies, the recruiter will offer you some coaching on how to succeed at this stage. Don’t be shy about asking for help at this point. You will also find a lot of resources online to interview. For Amazon, it’s important to know the Leadership Principles. You should also check other sites for interview tips, such as Glassdoor and Blind.\nIn behavioral questions, it’s useful to structure your answer in a way that gives a lot of information to the interviewer in a short amount of time. Amazon prefers a method called STAR, which is described in this web page. I find that method to be useful to when interviewing for other companies as well.\nIf you’re interviewing for a technical position, besides a behavioral question, at this point you will be asked to solve a technical problem. In most cases, this will usually be something equivalent to a Leetcode “hard easy” or “easy medium”. If the position that you’re interviewing for is a senior position, the question may be considerably harder.\nThere are a lot of books and sites talking about how to prepare for a phone screen. The most famous one is Cracking the Code Interview. You should prepare the best you can for the phone screen. You should prepare even more if you see that your phone screen is with the hiring manager.\nIt’s not hard to fail phone screens. I have failed phone screens. I have programmed in SQL for 20+ years, and I have failed SQL phone screens. In a recent phone screen, an interviewer asked about MVC models (Model-View-Controller) and the interviewee answered about NBCs (Naive Bayes’ Classifiers) because the sound quality of the call was not so good. That could have been a disaster, but both interviewer and interviewee realized that something was wrong and recovered.\nIn most processes, the phone screen is pass/recycle/fail, instead of just pass/fail. If you don’t pass but you got close, you may get recycled to the “CV Review” phase of a similar position. When hiring managers are hiring for multiple positions (for example, SDE I and SDE II), if you fail the “higher” phone screen (e.g., SDE II) you can still be recycled for the “lower” (e.g. SDE I) phone screen and proceed to the next phase.\nFinally, hiring managers band together, because hiring managers need a lot of experienced interviewers for the on-site interview. If you barely fail a phone screen with one hiring manager but would have passed the phone screen for a different position with with another hiring manager (that would mean a different position or a lower level position), it’s possible that he will refer you to another hiring manager."

The recruiter is likely to offer you some help and point you to some interview resources. Be sure to pay attention to the recruiter - they are on your side.\nIn all companies that I have worked for or with, when you get to the on-site interview we are hiring for the company, not for the position. We will bring your potential future internal clients to the loop. We will bring your potential future colleagues to the loop. Your hiring manager will be in the loop. These are likely the people that will work with you day in and day out.\nMost technical interview loops are a combination of behavioral and technical interviews. The balance may vary substantially. You should be prepared for at least 40% of technical interviews, although it could be as much as 80%. The remainder will be about behavioral questions. Remember to follow the STAR method to answer questions. This will serve you well even if you’re not interviewing for Amazon.\nIt is extremely rare for a candidate to ace all interviews in a loop. Don’t be discouraged if you gave less than perfect answers a couple times. The outcome will be decided based on the opinions of all interviewers. In my (long) career, I’ve seen many loops in which the decision to hire was not unanimous and even some cases when the opinion was far from unanimous and the person still got hired and did well. Usually, the opinion of the most senior person in the loop weighs more.\nOffer If you got here, congratulations. We think you’re a good fit and want you to be a bigger part of our lives!\nMost companies have somewhat strict offer ranges for their positions and levels. That’s less true about very high levels (ranges tend to be broad), but very common for lower levels (ranges tend to be narrow). The vast majority of offers will start in the midpoint of that strict range.\nCompanies want to make an offer that a candidate will accept, because they want a candidate they liked to start sooner rather than later. I have heard about “low ball” offers inviting negotiation (especially on Blind), but I have never personally seen one.\nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t negotiate. If you don’t like the offer, you should certainly negotiate. If you don’t like the offer even after the negotiation, it’s time to decline and walk away. I have done this several times in my life and even regretted a few, but in general, it’s for the best.\nThat also doesn’t mean that you should always negotiate. Companies want you to accept offers and be happy you did, so it’s not uncommon for the first offer to be really good. If you are already happy, there’s some risk in negotiating. It’s important to be careful to not be final when negotiating, especially for small amounts. You don’t want to risk painting yourself in a corner for a very small potential gain.\nFor example, if you currently have a total compensation of $160k and are offered $199k (which you secretly love), it would be unproductive to go to a position of “it’s either $203k or I walk away”. That small difference may put you out of the range (e.g., the range may be 160k-200k), and even if you receive a counter of $200k (the maximum that can be offered for that position) you may feel like you have to walk away because your demands have not been met. When walking into a negotiation, know what you want, be firm but flexible. And if you love the first offer, take it. Remember that every week you delay your start can cost you approximately 2% of your first year’s salary: a year has 52 weeks."

This doesn’t help these candidates, for reasons I explained before and that I’ll summarize below.\nImagine there are two identical candidates that qualify for the position. Candidate A applies immediately. Candidate B sends a message asking the hiring manager to review their CV or profile before they apply, and perhaps also asks to meet.\nUsually, the reason why the hiring manager is hiring is because there’s more work to be done than their team can currently handle. So the hiring manager is likely to be very busy, and it will take some time for them to answer. Their calendar may be super full.\nBy the time the manager finally answers, even if the answer is “yes, your basic qualifications match what was posted in the position”, Candidate A is probably already doing their phone screen. By the time Candidate B meets with the hiring manager to decide whether to apply, Candidate A is receiving an offer.\nIn addition, after all that effort, the hiring manager could observe that Candidate B didn’t read instructions attentively, needs help with very simple tasks, and does not show “bias for action”.\nI have a keyboard shortcut that essentially types: “If you fit the basic qualifications and the position interests you, just apply directly through the link I provided”.\nThat approach works for me because of my particular situation: many good candidates, attractive company, lots of positions. In other situations (e.g., a smaller company) I’d probably have another approach: for example, I might offer to review resumes.\nThe key point is to interact with the hiring manager in the way they are suggesting. They are trying to help you succeed. If they’re suggesting you should apply, then apply. If they’re asking for you to send them a resume or reply with “Interested”, then that’s the best approach."

Maybe there’s something in the position that is unintentionally blocking otherwise good candidates. Maybe I will post a position soon that actually fits your profile, and I will let you know in these cases.\nMost of the times, requirements are well vetted - for example, almost all my positions require a lot of SQL, but it’s possible that some requirements are confusing, not properly explained, or even unnecessary.\nMessages about why you did not apply are helpful to the extent that they are illuminating - telling me that you didn’t apply for a database engineer position because you don’t know SQL is not that helpful. Telling me that you didn’t apply to an entry level position because it says it requires a Ph.D. and 25+ years of experience would help uncover an error.\nNote that these are my personal preferences, and the preferences of other hiring managers can vary."

Do you sniff it first to make sure it’s not spoiled or drink it outright?\nSniffing tends to be the lower cost solution. It’s an imperfect solution, as maybe you’ll find tomorrow that the milk was spoiled but wasn’t stinky yet. However, if the milk is spoiled and already stinky, sniffing it is a lot less disgusting than taking a sip.\nThe phone screen is a sniff test. It is imperfect, it may be a bad experience, but it has a much lower cost than an interview. Although we occasionally use information from the phone screen in further steps of the hiring process, the main goal of a phone screen is to assess whether a candidate has a chance to pass the on-site interview.\nGiven the potential high costs of a false positive in a phone screen, interviewers that do phone screens tend to be more experienced than the average on-site interviewer. It’s also common for the hiring manager to be a phone screener. A phone screen can sometimes be the hardest interview in the whole process."

In that case, people in the interview panel may be annoyed at the phone screener.\nThere are several other outcomes that won’t be judged as harshly: the candidate fails the interview but just barely, the candidate fails the interview for that position but is a good fit for another, the candidate fails the interview for that position level but can be hired at a lower level. The phone screener won’t get called out on those.\nIt’s a lot harder to see failures when the candidate is rejected at the phone screen interview, as it’s harder to track what happened to the candidate. There are several cases of developers failing a phone screen in a company and being hired (and becoming very successful) in another, sometimes more prestigious, company.\nNote that the incentives are biased towards phone screeners rejecting more candidates than they should. This is a good reason to have phone screen interviewers be more experienced people (who may care less about other people being annoyed at them) or the hiring manager, who would take more risk to hire candidates.\nI have no scientific basis or good data for my next statement, but I think that regardless of the incentives above, phone screens still tend towards having more false negatives, that is, they reject people that would do well."

    "text": "How people fail phone screens\n\nCheating\nOne of the defining characteristics of phone screens is that they are remote. Therefore, it’s easier to cheat on them. The whole interviewing process is grueling, and the benefits of passing are pretty great, so I do understand why people want to cheat. I imagine it even works for some people. When it doesn’t work, however, it’s pretty bad.\n\nAs is widely known, lot of technical interview questions and their answers are available on LeetCode. Some interviewers use LeetCode questions, but adapt them for the phone screen interview, usually with good intentions: adding simplifying conditions to make the question easier and therefore making it possible to complete the question during a phone screen.\nWhen cheating candidates hear the question and search for it in LeetCode, they are usually elated to find the answer and gleefully type it pretending that they’re thinking about it on the spot. However, since the question was adapted, the LeetCode answer doesn’t work, it doesn’t even make any sense: it solves a different, more complex problem than the one being asked.\nAlthough the consequences may vary, they are at best the same as being eliminated by simply failing. If the candidate were to try to answer the question normally, they would probably do much better.\n\n\nLying on their resumes\nIf the position requires SQL or some programming language, you are likely to be asked questions about SQL or that programming during the phone screen. I have seen candidates apply to positions that require SQL, write that they know SQL in their resume, get to the phone screen, and then say that they don’t know SQL when asked basic questions.\nThe rational explanation I can come up with is that these candidates are hoping for a false positive. As bad as the interview process is, it’s more likely to generate false negatives than false positives, and I think a candidate would have better chances playing the lottery.\n\n\nNot talking through their thinking\nThe candidate is asked a question, but actually doesn’t know exactly how to solve it. Maybe they are nervous and forgot not only the syntax but even some concepts. Maybe they aren’t as experienced as their resume led the recruiters to believe.\nBy talking through their thinking, candidates can show that they know something, and would usually get some hints if they’re going in the right direction. However, at least once a quarter I have some candidate that becomes absolutely silent instead of talking through what they’re thinking and eventually gives up. This makes it hard to help these candidates."

The interviewers asked the same question that everybody had just seen to the “candidates”. The interviews were recorded and the “candidates” and interviewers were told that the recordings would be shown to students and some of their colleagues. This last part was a trigger: this was supposed to make the “candidates” nervous and self-conscious.\nThe question was a LeetCode “easy” question. The “candidates” were senior developers and they had seen the answer minutes before. Regardless, 3 of them (60%) couldn’t complete the question in 20 minutes with hints. The remaining 2 “candidates” needed hints to finish. All of them missed some key detail.\nRegardless, they would all pass a phone screen."

They check with the interviewer if their understanding, assumptions and strategy make sense. It is easier to fix problems in the beginning rather than after they start coding.\n\n\nThey are organized\nWhile I understand a candidate will be very nervous during a phone screen and that is likely going to make it harder for them to organize their thinking, I think the strategies below will help them calm down and still be able to organize their thinking.\n\nThey comment their code: I wish I saw more comments in production. Of course, I wish I saw more comments in interviews. These comments may help you structure your thinking better and not forget things.\nThey use meaningful function and variable names: I wish I saw more meaningful names in production code. Of course, I wish I saw more meaningful names in interviews. This will help you remember what your code is supposed to do, and it will also help the interviewer understand what you’re trying to do and help you.\n\n\n\nThey don’t try to show perfection during the phone screen\nI always try to tell my candidates that I don’t expect perfection, using different words. Although perfection may happen - I see it about once a year - most candidates will not get the answers completely correct. They will forget some condition, have some syntax problem, provide a solution that is not optimal. That’s usually ok.\nTrying to be perfect is likely to make candidates focus on the wrong things during the interview and get nervous if they can’t be perfect at that time, which will in turn prevent them from showing a lot of things that they’re perfectly good at."

The “to solve Y” part is frequently omitted, wasting time for everyone.\nLet me do an example to illustrate the problem. Jay is a new hire, recently hired from a prestigious school, to be the data analyst for a Finance team in a big tech company. The fiscal year is ending, and the company’s accountant asks Jay for a report that aggregates tax expenses by country. Jay recently used pandas in Jupyter for a different project, and the graphs that the accountant wants are similar to what Jay just did. Jay decides to ask “How can I connect a Jupyter notebook to the corporate database?”, so that Jay can use pandas to do fulfill the accountant’s request. When asking for help, Jay didn’t state why they want to connect their Jupyter notebook to the corporate database\nWhat Jay doesn’t know (and the accountant also doesn’t know) is that a Power BI report that does what the accountant needs already exists, and everybody in Finance has access to it.\nPeople spend time helping Jay connect to the corporate database. Jay spends time getting permissions, installing and configuring packages, etc. to solve a problem that was already solved. All this time is invested in something that is unnecessary, instead of being invested in improving the onboarding experience and documentation so that Jay and the accountant could learn that the report they needed already existed.\nDon’t be like Jay! State the problem you’re trying to solve, rather than asking for help with a specific task. You may learn a lot more.\nI love shortcuts such as “the XY problem” to explain complex concepts. I have a list in my blog."

Perversely, high-performance ICs that become manager have a handicap: they are usually a lot faster than their (new) direct reports. Instead of trying to develop and apply team management skills, these new managers sometimes take over work from their team members, preventing learning and growing, frustrating people and reducing the team’s effectiveness."

In addition to 1:1s, managers also spend time talking to a whole lot of other people: their own managers, clients (internal and/or external), partner teams, suppliers, HR, Finance, recruiting. They also represent their team in planning meetings and review meetings. All those conversations add up, as it can be seen in a sample manager calendar below, in which all purple meetings are conversations with other people.\n\nWith that much pressure on their calendars, it’s no surprise that managers give a lot of value to meeting efficiency.

Experienced managers develop large and deep networks, both internally and externally.\nThe external network allows managers to recruit external candidates more quickly and to keep a pulse in the job market. The internal network is important for several reasons: the first and more obvious is to find internal candidates, which tend to require less ramp-up.\nA second reason is that a lot of a team’s work depends on other teams. One way to develop these internal networks is to help fellow managers hire: experienced interviewers are always in demand.

Take too long to move and one may have enough “tech depth” to be frustrated at their team members lack of expertise, and may not have the “seat time” required to be an efficient manager for them.\n\nIt’s not all unicorns and rainbows, but there’s a lot of good\nI found that I derive a lot more pleasure at telling somebody that they got the job that they applied for than from getting a new job myself. A similar thing happened when telling somebody that they got a promotion. And when somebody’s article got accepted to a conference. And in many other similar things.\nI found that I enjoyed helping others succeed through early experiences with mentorship, before I became a manager. Being a manager is living vicariously and enjoying it. It’s not that I don’t enjoy being personally successful, but being a part of great teams and helping them succeed brought me more happiness than I think I could have found on my own.\nWhen you feel the same, it’s worth it trying it out."

Most of them don’t know that I’m neurodivergent and an introvert. Instead, I have been described as example of an extrovert and “avid networker”.\nThe easiest way to notice my neurodivergency is that I rarely make eye contact. When I do, it’s because my conscious mind reminded me that I’m not making eye contact and pushed me to do it. It takes effort and concentration. That doesn’t help me as an interviewee. When I’m an interviewer, I tell people that I like taking copious notes (because it’s true) and this usually sets them at ease with my lack of eye contact.\nI also suffer from “meeting recovery syndrome”, a concept I learned about in the book “The Surprising Science of Meetings”. After meeting people, especially a large group, I need some time alone to recover, usually by being alone for at least 15 minutes.\nBy knowing these things about myself, I can plan around them better. For example, I book time to work on an individual project (e.g., writing a promotion document) after a large meeting, and book breaks after small meetings. And I can have the career I chose and love even if I don’t fit the mold of most other people in that role."

Your colleagues or your manager can tell you what it takes to get promoted. Getting promoted is a good thing: it will give you a better salary and sometimes an expanded scope that will allow you to have opportunities to grow even further.\nI had many career conversations in my tenure, and in a large proportion of cases, “getting promoted on the job I currently hold” is not a typical lifelong objective, but it’s typically an objective that people have a plan for. On the other hand, people frequently tell me about major goals/objectives (change professions, open their own company, get a Ph.D., etc.) for which they don’t have an action plan.\nIt’s like their algorithm is stuck near a local maxima (in this text, optimizing will mean maximizing) and the only thing they can see is the short-term objective, so they can only trace paths to get to the local maxima.\n\nEventually, people reach a local maxima and realize it’s not their global objective. They may not know what their global objective is, they just know “it’s not this”. Interestingly, the way that people solve that problem is not that different from what an algorithm would do if it realized it got stuck in a local maxima: take a big step, and start again from someplace else."

    "text": "THe multi-armed bandit\nThe hardest problem to solve in career optimization is lack of information. People may have some general idea of where they want to go, but usually not much. For example, I commonly hear people saying that they want to become managers, but after just a few questions I realize that they don’t really know what that means and whether they actually want that.\nOne way to maximize happiness under incomplete information is to explore several different things, and once you find what makes you happy, then you exploit it (although “exploit” is a somewhat aggressive word in English, it’s actually the technical term), getting as much happiness as you can from it. There are algorithms to find a good balance between exploration and exploitation. One example is the “multi-armed bandit”.\nThe concept comes from slot machines in casinos. Because a slot machine has one lever that people pull to activate it and people usually lose money on it, it’s called an “one-armed bandit”.\nImagine a slot machine that has multiple levers, therefore a “multi-armed bandit”. When pulled, each lever gives a prize based on a statistical distribution that is unknown to the player. You pull the first lever and get $100. Should you pull the same lever again or switch? Maybe one of the other levers has a constant payoff of $1,000. Maybe that lever you just pulled is actually the best one.\nWithout knowing the distributions, you can’t know the optimal action to take. In real life, not only one doesn’t know the distributions, but the distributions for each lever can change over time. If that was not complicated enough, you also have infinite levers to choose from. Nobody said it was supposed to be easy.\n\nThe multi-armed bandit problem doesn’t have a general optimal solution, but has several strategies that achieve approximate solutions. It is a classical reinforcement learning problem.\nMany strategies are very simple “epsilon” strategies, for which one decides a proportion epsilon (between 0 and 1) of exploration (trying to figure out the distributions of the available actions), and the remainder of the time is used for exploitation (performing the action that is expected to yield the best results).\nIn career conversations, I always suggest that people take the time to explore new things, especially things that are in the (conceptual) neighborhood of what they think they want. Because I’m older than the average tech person, they may think this is some form of ancient wisdom, but I’m just pointing them towards a classical (and somewhat modern) reinforcement learning algorithm.\nThat’s using data science in production."

While the “bias exploitation” story may be true, there’s also an economic reason why using Cunningham’s Law is a nice thing to do.\nA common example of when posting the wrong answer is expected is in Stack Overflow: when asking your question, it’s a good practice to show what you already tried and what’s not working (essentially posting the wrong answer).\nThe advantage of such a protocol is that it makes it easier on the people trying to help. Consider the example “Who is Luke’s father?”. Asked as a question, there’s a lot of context missing: Luke the Apostle? Luke Skywalker? Luke Wilson? My neighbor Luke?\nOn the other hand, the incorrect statement “Han Solo is Luke’s father” provides a lot of additional context: this is about Star Wars, and it also provides how the question asker expects the answer to look like.

One of the problems they wanted to solve was “does contacting customers help at all?”\nIt’s an important question. After all, the cost of collections is directly related to the number of contacts. The more contacts, the more people.\nThe DS had a table with of invoices and payment dates, and a table with a history of contacts by invoice. Using the invoice issue date and invoice payment date, he created a payment delay metric. Then, he joined the contact history and created a metric for number of contacts. Finally, he calculated the correlation between the number of contacts and payment delay.\nHe was startled by the results: the more contacts per invoice, the longer it took customers to pay.\nHe told the collections manager, who got very excited. He long suspected that the contact center had too many people. Now he had some proof.\nThe DS carefully separated the data in a training and a test sample, and trained a regression model using XGBoost. Given inputs such as the invoice country and amount, the model predicted the delay in days given an estimated number of contacts. The model had a very low error (<0.5d) in the training dataset. When using the unseen test dataset, the error was also minimal.\nThe DS and the collections manager made a plan to deploy a tool to collectors. When assigned an invoice, collectors should enter the characteristics of the invoice in the tool and add 1 contact. For example, if a collector was assigned an invoice with 10 days delay and 2 contacts, they should enter 3 as the number of contacts. If the model returned a number larger than the current delay, the collector should not make the contact. They should just wait.\nOnce the tool was deployed, the number of contacts initially dropped a lot. To the collections manager surprise, however, the payment delays also increased. Customers were paying much later than usual, and ended up having to be contacted anyway.\nAs you may already have realized, the problem with the idea was that customers were not delaying because they were annoyed with too many contacts. The relation went in the other direction: customers were being contacted because they were late. While contacts and lateness was very correlated, lateness caused contacts, not the other way around.\nThe project was scrapped. The team decided that data science was all hype. The data scientist moved on to another team. The collections team went back to the old way of contacting customers: about once per week until they paid.\nIt took a while (and a new data scientist) for that team to trust data science again: a few years later, a new data scientist started experimenting with assigning different strategies to randomized customers, and that improved collections a lot. But that’s another tale."

An analyst had been doing that for about ten years, and had a record of cash actually received per month going back all those years. He realized that some months, like December, received a lot more cash than others, like February.\nThe analyst used Excel to calculate the percentage change for each month. For example, if the company received $100M in October 2009 and $80M in November 2009, he recorded -20% for Nov 2009. To calculate November 2021, he would take the average of the percentage changes for November over the last 10 years (2011 to 2020) and apply it to the October 2020 number.\nIt didn’t work too well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was around 20%. For some months, the forecast missed by a lot, causing significant problems, including having to urgently borrow cash at significant cost. Eventually, the company decided to hire a data science consulting company.\nThe consulting company immediately concluded that the problem was due to lack of data. Ten years of monthly data resulted in just 120 data points. To do data science, they said, they needed more than that. Luckily, the analyst had also been recording the daily data. Now, with thousands of data points, the consulting company used an LSTM deep learning model to forecast cash by day. It also didn’t work too well, but when they aggregated it by month, it did a lot better than the analyst’s original forecast: MAPE was closer to 10%.\nThe project was celebrated as a success. A press release was issued, promoting the benefits of using cloud technologies and deep learning for more accurate financial forecasting. The person who hired the consultants was promoted.\nA few months later, a new data scientist joined the company, looked at the monthly data, and used the Excel FORECAST.ETS function to achieve a MAPE of 1% in seconds. This time, there was no press release.\nWhen starting a data science project, be careful about the baseline you’re using to determine success. Choosing a poor baseline (like the original analyst model) can result in thinking that fairly bad outcomes (like the one from the LSTM model) are good, just because they’re better than horrible outcomes. I’ve seen a number of cases in which a simple heuristic handily beat a complicated ML model."

Of course, measuring things is tricky, and an art that we #DataScientists are (or at least should be) very familiar with. Measuring things differently, Seattle has around 150 “sunny days” per year, and Miami has around 250. That’s almost three months less.\nMeasuring things in yet another way, the average number of hours of sunlight in Seattle per year is approximately 2,000. Miami and LA get approximately 3,200. Las Vegas gets 3,800. Besides being cloudy and rainy, Seattle is further to the north, and the sun sets before 5 PM for a large part of the winter.\nI find that the lack of sunlight gets to me a lot more than the rain and the temperature, both of which I actually enjoy.\nOne trick I learned is to use “corn cob lightbulbs” everywhere in my house. A 50W corn cob bulb produces 5,000 lumens. A typical 13W CFL light produces about 1,000 lumens, the same as a 60W incandescent light. After installing corn cob lightbulbs in my office, I started feeling a lot less tired after a long day of #wfh during the winter, even finding energy to cook and play board games with my kids.\nIf you’re considering to move to Seattle, it’s not about the umbrellas. It rarely rains hard enough to justify using one. It’s more about finding a way of being outside when there’s sunlight (and there are plenty of great things to do around Seattle what that’s the case) and getting enough illumination when one can’t go out."

We are, after all, hired because of our deep expertise and experience. It’s not uncommon for a senior, experienced person to think that what was done before them was “wrong” and that they could easily do what’s “right”.\nThe reality is that, most times, whomever did the previous version is an accomplished professional had to make lots of decisions under constrained resources. I find that it’s usually hubris from my side to think that I can easily understand and solve all those problems quicker and better than they did. Fences don’t sprout from the ground - there’s a reason why a specific fence was put up there in the first place.\nI frequently learn a lot when trying to understand the reasons why the original decisions were made. Occasionally, the original solution can really be improved on, but after understanding why it was made in the first place I also learn of constraints I didn’t know. In many other cases, I learn of constraints that would actually create significant problems for the new idea I had, and that saves me and everyone else significant time.\nWhen I was less experienced and less careful, I brought down plenty of fences unnecessarily, and was later surprised to find escaped sheep on the road and farmers yelling at me.\nI also posted about other concepts, such as the XY Problem and Cunningham’s Law.

It’s just a little more. When I shadowed other interviewers, I noticed that my questions are just as hard, if not harder. If I noticed one difference, it’s that I tend to start with a quick, easier question, which usually cost me less than five minutes, and I’m then quickly at or above the average difficulty level of my peer interviewers.\nI do this because it is extremely common for the interviewee to be nervous during an interview. Like on the movie Gladiator, you don’t know what will come out when the gates open, even though you prepared a lot for it. If the first question throws the interviewee off, it’s often hard for them to regain confidence. It’s quicksand.\n\nI like #interview questions that are “adaptive”, like the GMAT, meaning that you can make them easier or harder by changing small things. Sometimes, people would actually be able to do the hard version of the question, but they’re nervous and need to start with the easy one.\nAs commonplace as it is, the interview process is very imperfect, and usually tends to yield false negatives: meaning that it fails people that would have succeeded.

Recruiting was superb, training was excellent, and work-life balance (at least on my team) was extremely good. If you have the opportunity to work for Amazon, it’s a solid choice. In particular, CTPS is a great team to work for. The leadership on my team was inspiring: not only they are smart and accomplished, they are also great human beings. I will miss them.\nWhat I will miss the most, however, are the people in my immediate team, many of whom I hired myself. I will miss you a lot. You are extremely competent and I’m lucky to have worked with you for this period of time, which now feels way too short. I learned a lot from you and will take it with me in my future adventures. I wish you the very best on your careers and I hope we meet again soon."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have recently announced that I’m leaving Amazon and starting a new job (yet to be announced) next week. This means that I have been on the interviewee side of the interview process somewhat recently.\nOne of the most important things to know is that the way of getting better at interviewing is… well, interviewing! It’s good to be on both sides of the table, both as an interviewer and as an interviewee. Practice helps you to do better, but it also helps you see where you’re not doing well.\nI have two policies about interviewing. The first policy is that I will accept an invitation to interview at least once a year, even if I’m happy with my job, which I frequently am. I don’t like wasting people’s time, so it has to be a place that I would really consider going to if the process worked out. The reason for that policy is that I once spent many years without interviewing and when a good opportunity showed up, I was very out of practice, and I think a lot of me not getting it was because I barely understood how the process worked in other companies. I’m not sure I’ll keep this policy.\nThe second policy, which I’m even less sure of its helpfulness, is that once I decide that I’m willing to change jobs, I will be fairly open to interview for lots of different things. For example, if I get invited to interview for my dream job and decide that I would leave my current job for it, I’ll interview for lots of other jobs as well. This gives me a lot of extra work and stress (interviewing is hard), but it also allows me to practice a lot and find my weaker spots, and to have a backup in case things don’t work out.\nOne of the hardest questions for me is “why do you want to leave your current job and join us”. I tend to like the job I have, and also tend to be more forthcoming than the average interviewee. My sincere answer is usually far away from “this is my dream job”. It’s possible that I have only succeeded in my latest interview because it’s a place that I really, really, really love and admire in a company that I love and admire, too. It was sincerely my dream job and team. In any case, after some practice in interviews (and lots of help from Katie Baird, PCC) I started to get better at answering that question, while still being sincere, which led to far more offers/quasi-offers.\nTo wrap this up, I want to recognize that my experience above is one of extreme privilege: I have been around for a long time, and I’m extremely fortunate to be invited to interview. A large number of people are in earlier stages, when even getting an interview is hard. If you are in that situation, I think the takeaway is to still try to get as much practice as you can (by being open even after you’re far into some process, by doing mock interviews in both sides of the table, etc.). I hope your time will come and I hope that I can help."

It’s a lot easier for me to keep the conversations going after someone reaches out, and knowing what people I care about are currently doing honestly made my life better.\nOf course, that works for me because I like writing, and even with three kids, I manage to find enough peace and quiet that I get to write from time to time.

    "text": "Should you choose #Microsoft or #FAANG?\nLast week, a Microsoft #recruiter I admire and has a lot of followers posted something about Microsoft being the gateway to FAANG. Having been into both Microsoft and FAANG and having participated on hundreds of recruiting processes for both (as an interviewer, hiring manager and interviewee), I have #feelings about this. Lots of feelings.\nFirst off, let’s get my economist way of thinking and potential biases out of the way. By revealed preference, you know I prefer Microsoft to FAANG, at least under the conditions that were offered to me. I recently chose to come back to work for Microsoft from FAANG (I also had recent offers from other FAANGs). Therefore, take my words with a grain of salt.\nAlso, given recent performance, FAANGs are not an investment thing anymore. For pop-investing fans, the acronym is now MAMAA, one of which is Microsoft (Netflix was dropped).\nBut this doesn’t matter, since the main argument about FAANGs was about recruiting: FAANGs (allegedly) pay better than Microsoft. There are non-FAANG companies that also (at least used to) pay extremely well (e.g., Airbnb and Uber). When recruiters compete against FAANGs, it’s a difficult fight. It’s not uncommon to have a FAANG offer that is 50% over other companies. You don’t have to spend a lot of time in Blind to find out that in terms of total compensation, FAANGs pay very well.\nI can tell you: it’s great to be paid very well. I can also tell you: it’s not the only thing that matters.\nAs a data scientist, I think a lot about optimization problems. If your personal career optimization problem is solving for maximizing short-term total compensation (TC), FAANGs are great. And, as that same recruiter wrote in a subsequent post, there’s no shame on having that goal.\nBut maybe you want to optimize for other things: work/life balance, impact, stress, learning, risk, work environment. Short-term TC is super important, especially in when you want to get a house, buy a car, get established, pay those student loans. But after some point, it may matter less to you. Privilege check: this is about choosing between high degrees of privilege, and I’m blessed and humbled to have the opportunity to choose, as many in the tech area do.\nFor the opportunities that were available to me, Microsoft was by far the best option for what I was optimizing for: learning, working with people I admire, work life balance, being able to talk about my work, having lasting impact on the world, and very good compensation with lower stock market risk.\nAs any person that knows about Goodhart’s Law or Charlie Munger can tell you, you get what you optimize for. When you’re choosing what you are optimizing for, make sure that it is what you really want."

It was not.\n\nWhat I wanted in a blog platform\nFor a long time, I had an unfulfilled wish list for a blog platform:\n\nCan write posts in Markdown\nEasy to deploy to Github\nCan script in Python\n\nA large number of platforms fulfills the first two items, but I struggled to find one that fulfilled the last item. I finally found Pelican, but I found it too clunky and started to worry that it was not going to be maintained for long. Therefore, I oscillated between Jekyll and Hugo (using blogdown) for a long time. I liked blogdown a lot, but whenever I’m switching a lot between R and Python, my brain gets really unhappy.\n\n\nQuarto has everything, and more\nRecently, I found Quarto that ticks all my boxes and solves a lot of other problems. My feeling when using Quarto must be similar to the feeling of Python programmers when they started using Jupyter (because they never used RStudio) or similar to what I felt when, as an analyst, started using RStudio. Things just work.\nWhen I was initially switching between Jekyll and Hugo, one of the most annoying things was Jekyll preferred posts as files, while blogdown preferred posts as directories. RStudio even provides a function bundle_site() to convert files to directories. Now, when I’m converting to Quarto, I thought I needed to write such a function in Python.\nAgain, it turns out that “things just work”. Quarto accepts both directores and files as posts and rendered everything correctly. So I’m going to draw the “Quarto Spiral” instead, just to celebrate!\n\n\nExample from Hello, Quarto!\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nr = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)\ntheta = 2 * np.pi * r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(\n  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} \n)\nax.plot(theta, r)\nax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])\nax.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A line plot on a polar axis"

    "text": "One of the worst things I have done as a manager was to go to a meeting. Luckily, I had a friend on that meeting (also a manager) that taught me something really important.\nHere’s what I did wrong.\nThere was this meeting between several data science teams. It was really hard to find a time that worked for everybody. The meeting ended up being scheduled on a Friday morning, at about 9 AM on the day I was going on vacations. I couldn’t go, so I gave the meeting to one of my directs and we planned it out together. Some of the other teams had prep meetings, of which both me and my direct could (and did) participate. I couldn’t be on the big meeting to align on the roadmap, but it was well-supported and felt like everything was under control. Other members of my team would also attend to provide details about their projects, and they were well-prepared.\nOn the day of the meeting, which was also the first day of my long-awaited vacations, I was packed and ready to leave for my trip when I got a notice that my flight was delayed. I was planning to leave home a little after 9 AM, but now I could safely leave 10:30 AM and still arrive comfortably at the airport. Staying home longer would even mean less traffic to the airport.\nWith time to spare, I decided to join the meeting, even though I was a little late. When I joined, the meeting stopped, and people said something to the effect of “Oh, Lucas, I thought you were on vacation and were not going to join”, to which I responded: “I’m on vacations, but my flight was delayed. Since I could join and didn’t want to miss the meeting, I joined”.\nSurprisingly directly and publicly, my friend on the meeting said: “Nah, you should log off. Otherwise, you’re going to start giving my team and your team the impression that they should join meetings during their vacations if they can, and that’s not setting a good example for work life balance”. (This was at Amazon, by the way).\nI flushed for 10 seconds (it was an audio call only, thankfully) but realized she was completely right. I was a little embarrassed for being called out in public, but I’m usually not embarrassed for being wrong, at least not for long. I said: “You’re right, sorry for the disruption, I’m the least prepared for this meeting since I wasn’t planning to attend, and I’m sure I’ll be updated when I get back, I’ll drop off now”, got a bunch of “Have a good vacation” and disconnected.\nIn addition to showing that “vacations are important”, I also had the opportunity to show that “being wrong is ok”. Nobody was shutting me out. When I came back, I took over that workstream and ran it to the end. I was just making it harder for my team to help me by showing that I could help myself. Besides, we were just being fiercely protective of the work/life balance that we worked so hard to achieve on that group.\nI didn’t realize the message I was sending, and I was glad to be called out."

    "text": "Years ago, in a tech conference, a researcher asked: “Isn’t it embarrassing that the conference center urinals can detect when you’re done and automatically flush, but your computer can’t detect that you’re not using it and automatically lock?”\n\n\n\nThis seemingly simple problem is harder than it looks. People don’t (normally) quietly stare at urinals for several minutes, but that can happen to computer screens (e.g., watching a movie or presentation, reading a document).\nNewer phones and tablets use eye tracking to save battery. They can figure out whether you’re looking at a screen, and if you’re not, lock. It works well, but these are devices that you almost always hold close to your face, so they can keep a camera pointing at you all the time. If you cover the camera or use an external monitor, you start having problems. With computers, I have a very strong preference for using external monitors, so I’m already in the problem situation to begin with. The solution could be to add a sensor to each monitor or camera, but given the thousands of models available, that could get complicated.\nDuring my long career, I’ve seen many pranks on people that left their computers unlocked. Some places look down at the person who left the computer unlocked, but I actually prefer the places that chastise the pranksters: instead of pranking, it would be better if they locked the computer and kindly had a word with the forgetful person.\nIn any case, one of my favorite Windows 11 features (apparently also present in Windows 10) is the ability to lock my computer automatically when I move away from it.\nThe way to do that is a little convoluted: you need to pair your Bluetooth phone with your computer (which, of course, also needs to have Bluetooth), and when your computer, using Bluetooth, detects that your phone moved away from your computer, it will automatically lock.\nFrom my description above, you probably already appreciate how a seemingly simple problem that we can solve for a urinal can be hard to solve even if your device has a lot more features.\nThe people who implemented the feature still couldn’t solve all problems. What to do if the user doesn’t have their phone today? Current solution: just show an error message. What to do if the user moves away but leaves the phone nearby? We detect phones, not users, so it will leave it unlocked.\nIn any case, I’m glad to see that computers of 2020s are inching closer to the toilets of the early 2000s."

Whenever we travel, we always like checking out the Mediterranean food options. We loved Layla for Lebanese food, and Stella’s for Greek food. We also went to Swig and Swine for barbecue, although we preferred The Home Team on Sullivan Island.\nWe stayed at the Wild Dunes Resort Residences at Sweetgrass, which was surprisingly affordable (we booked our stay several months in advance). The best surprise was having a washer and dryer in our room, which was helpful given how often the kids went to the pool.

I did ask a teacher what did ‘Knowledge is power, France is bacon’ mean and got a full 10-minute explanation of the Knowledge is power bit but nothing on ‘France is bacon’. When I prompted further explanation by saying ‘France is Bacon?’ in a questioning tone I just got a ‘yes’. At 12 I didn’t have the confidence to press it further.

That’s a lot to keep track of. Sometimes, I wanted to find something that I wrote and it would take me a while.\nNow, I use Quarto for everything.\nMy biggest audience is on LinkedIn, but it’s not that easy to post technical content. To my knowledge, there are three ways to do it:\n\nYou can write an article\nYou can create a training\nYou can post an external link\n\nThe problem of writing an article on LinkedIn is that the editor is good for text pieces but unfriendly for technical content, especially for code and source control. In addition, the editor requires the writer to edit online all the time. In practice, I mostly copied and pasted.\nThe problem of creating a training is that I think it’s a lot of work. I never tried, and maybe it’s easier than I think it is, but just getting started seems like a lot.\nInstead of using LinkedIn, a very popular option is to use Medium or, more specifically, “Towards Data Science” (TDS), a subset of Medium articles focused on data science. I frequently find articles I like in TDS, but it’s somewhat pay-walled. You get just a few free articles for free. For authors, the advantages are that TDS is widely promoted in search results and that authors get paid. Not enough to quit a job and write for TDS, but enough to buy a couple books per year. Other options are newsletters, but it starts to feel too much like a job.\nThe LinkedIn algorithm seems to punish posts that only point users to an external article. I can understand that: this type of post is unlikely to generate any engagement inside of LinkedIn: people just “click out”.\nIn any case, the problem I wanted to solve was to be able to write more technical posts from time to time, but still be able to post those to LinkedIn automatically. To write technical posts on my blog, I started using #Quarto and loving it. Recently, I wrote some code to configure Quarto to post automatically to LinkedIn. The code scans my Quarto files and uses the LinkedIn API to post them. If they fit fully as text, it posts them as a normal post. If they’re too large, it posts the beginning of the article and a link to my blog.\nNow, when I write a blog post (technical or non-technical) or even real work code, I can choose to automatically post it to LinkedIn and Twitter by simply adding some front-matter to my file.\nThis solves many problems for me. With that, I now do all my writing in VS Code. I don’t need to use Buffer anymore. I even have version control.\nNow I just need to write interesting stuff!"

I had to answer a (cute) questionnaire asking about my dog, her weight, and her food preferences. The result was a recommended food plan with a calculated number of calories, and a discounted price for a few weeks (I don’t remember if it was two or three).\n\n\nWhat I didn’t like\nThe first thing I didn’t like was that the number of calories was on the low side. Using another web calculator, I found that my dog would need 946kcal/day. The Farmer’s Dog calculator gave me less than 500kcal/day, about half of what I thought I needed, and about half of what I was currently feeding her.\nThe second thing was the price: after removing the initial discount, the price was about the same of the food I was currently using… but for half the calories.\nThe next thing was my own fault: I was counting on using the food right away, but it arrives deeply frozen, and I needed to wait about 36h for it to unfreeze. The package was a little unwieldy: the food comes as a paste in sealed plastic bag. I needed to use scissors to cut the top of the package and press out the paste into the bowl. It is hard to measure the exact quantity, and easy to get one’s hand dirty, which makes it harder to convince my kids to do it. Measuring the right amount is also tricky.\nThe food needs to be frozen, defrosted and kept refrigerated. That makes it inconvenient to use it in travel.\nDid I hate it? For the first few days I thought I would, but…\n\n\nWhat I liked\nThe Farmer’s Dog excels where it matters: the dog eats the food like there’s no tomorrow. I wouldn’t even need to clean the bowl. The only other case when I see her eating like that when she’s eating human food. Being a careful scientist, I thought this could be because she was hungry due to the lower calories, but I tested that she devours the food even after getting a lot of calories from other foods in prior meals. She really likes the food. I think it’s a staple of VC investments that they want to sell solutions rather than products, and this solved my main problem.\nThe downside: I had to adjust the calorie count up, which meant that the Farmer’s Dog is now more expensive than my previous food."

That’s called pluralistic ignorance. It’s a bad outcome for teams: the majority of team members knows something is missing, but each one thinks that they’re wrong. The team never realizes that the majority was right all along until it’s too late. The team makes a wrong decision.\nOne way to break out of pluralistic ignorance is to have someone is brave enough to ask a question, even if it is a naive, tedious or ill-phrased one. That can open the floodgates. It doesn’t matter the question was not that good by any measure, it can break the spell of pluralistic ignorance."

There’s usually a reason why the problem is still unsolved. The worst type of reason is when the interviewers are incapable of solving the problems themselves. In that case, it’s possible that the candidate will give the right answer and the interviewers won’t recognize it. That’s not very common, but I’ve seen it happen. The candidate is lucky if they don’t get the job.\nSome slightly better scenarios are when the interviewer could know the answer, but they don’t because answering that question hasn’t been a priority. In these cases, data is usually bad and/or the question is not well-defined. All those cases are clearly problematic for the candidate to solve under the pressure they face in the interview."

That’s also hard to pull off - the candidate is nervous, and the interviewer has the “curse of knowledge” - questions that are obvious to the interviewer may not be obvious to the candidate.\nEven if the interviewer is skilled and experienced enough to pull off something like that, the high-pressure setting of the interview also presents a problem for dealing with ambiguity. Time is ticking. It’s understandable that candidates will sometimes apply for jobs that require solving ambiguous problems under pressure, but those situations are usually different from interviews. When a person gets into a high-pressure situation at work, they usually have a lot of context and at least some preparation. Unless the candidate is aware beforehand that they will get this type of question, this is likely to work out poorly."

    "section": "",
    "text": "One thing I find in my interviews is that data scientists are a lot better at calculating expectations than they are at defining loss functions.\nUsing some recent (July 2022) events, I wrote a question that requires setting up and optimizing a loss function.\n“Musky promised to pay his friend Tweety US$ 1,000. Musky refused to pay, and now Tweety is suing Musky. Musky can either pay $1000 (Tweety won’t settle) or go to court. If Musky goes to court, he needs to pay lawyers. Good lawyers are costly, and don’t guarantee that Musky will win. The probability of Musky prevailing is a function of cost of his lawyers: ln(C)/7, where C is the amount Musky pays, and ln is the natural log function. Should Musky pay or go to court? If he goes to court, how much should Musky pay his lawyers? Assume Musky only cares about money.”\nThe first step is to set up the loss function in case Musky goes to trial. Going to trial requires paying C to the lawyers, and that gives Musky a probability to win of ln(C)/7, which means that his probability of losing is 1-ln(C)/7.\n\\[\nL = -C - (1- \\frac{ln(C)}{7}) \\times 1000\n\\]\nSince he only cares about money, Musky objective is to minimize his loss. To find the minimum of the loss function, we need to take the first derivative of this function and making it equal to zero. Luckily, natural logs have a simple derivative (1/x) and that’s not too hard to do. Regardless, I’d let candidates use Wolfram Alpha to take derivatives, or whatever calculator they want to.\nSince the derivative ends up being 1000/7C - 1, the next steps are simple, and the result is 1000/7, meaning that to minimize his losses, Musky should pay $143.86 to his lawyers.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta L}{\\delta C} = \\frac{1000}{7C} - 1\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{1000}{7C} - 1 = 0 \\implies C = \\frac{1000}{7} = 142.86\n\\]\nThis results in an expected loss of $434.02 (of which $142.86 goes to the lawyers). It’s bad, but it’s a lot better than losing $1000.\nIf you like data science interview questions, my friend Nirmal Budhathoki has been posting 30 days of them on LinkedIn. His questions are great (certainly better than mine above), and you should follow his series."

To help me with that, I wrote a tiny script that uses Twilio to text me when my model is done training.\nTwilio is inexpensive. At the time I’m writing this, it costs $1 per month for a phone number. You can also use your own phone number for 50 cents per month, but I didn’t try that yet. Each text costs less than 1 cent. Even in a month when I am getting lots of notifications, I usually spend less than $2.\nAfter importing the library, the code to send an update is an one-liner:\nclient.api.account.messages.create(to=, from_=, body=“Training done!”)\nHere’s a simple example of how this already saved me time. During the development of a model, I frequently do something like a LIMIT(1000) in my data to make sure the whole program (inputs, outputs, diagnostics) is working before running the model on the full data. I thought I was ready to go and kicked off the model, closed my computer and was going out for the day, without knowing that I had forgotten to remove the LIMIT(1000). Almost immediately, I got a text telling me that training was complete. I logged back in, removed the LIMIT(1000) from the data acquisition, and kicked off the training again.\nIf I didn’t receive the text, I would realize what happened only on the day after, and would have to wait for the model to run instead of simply starting my next day analyzing the results.\nThat’s pretty good value for one line."

Besides being a medical doctor, Dr. Bapu is also an economist.\nWhat I like the most about Freakonomics M.D. is that Dr. Bapu really takes the time to explain the experiment design of the paper being discussed. He explains why it works, what are the assumptions, confounders, limitations, etc. These are things that are usually confusing for students that are early in their research careers, and in my experience, for most professional data scientists. Many experiment designs are new to me. I find myself full of new ideas after every episode I listen to.\nAnother thing that the podcast taught me is the importance of knowing some big datasets well (the Medicare database appears in a lot of episodes), but also how to combine the data from these datasets with novel data.\nFor example, in the very first official episode, they explore whether children’s birthdays increase COVID transmissions. By looking at birthdays and insurance records, one can do an event study of whether having a children birthday in the house increases the odds of having a COVID infection the household afterwards (it does). The episode also discusses robustness checks.\nIn another episode, they explore whether distractions impact treatment outcomes. They take advantage of the existence of a database with surgery outcomes and another one with surgeon’s birthdays. Making the reasonable assumption that people are distracted on the day of their birthday, they find that surgery outcomes are in fact worse on surgeons’ birthdays.\nOverall, I highly recommend this podcast. It’s entertaining, and also useful in many subjects: #healthcare, #economics, #econometrics, and experiment design.\nThat’s a good value for my time.\n#ConversationsWithMyDog"

Students obediently copy the formulas and start working with them, learning about the interactions between their terms. They soon start imagining their applicability in the real world, where these conditions don’t hold.\nAn Economics professor walks into a lecture hall, puts some formulas on the whiteboard and states: “let’s assume consumers have rational preferences, which are defined as…”. Ten students storm out of the lecture hall. Two students start crying. A more outspoken student yells from the back: “Surely people aren’t rational!”\nThe professor tries to explain: “you know, rational preferences mean…” Another student chimes in: “Rational? Are you even watching the news? Half the people in this country aren’t rational”. All students agree, not immediately realizing that they would disagree about which half.\nA student wearing a designer Burberry t-shirt steps up: “Why are you implying that we’re all consumers? That’s predatory capitalism. Consumers is a no-no word, and from now on, please just refer to it as the c-word!”, while recording the interaction in their Swarovski encrusted iPhone for their TikTok followers.\nAt this very moment, the Physics professor steps into the Economics lecture hall: “Hey, you are being too noisy and disturbing my class. We’re doing science next door, can you please be quieter?” This helps. People start to calm down.\nThe Economics professor takes a deep breath. “As I was trying to explain, in Economics, rational preferences mean…”, but Burberry interrupts again, to the general agreement of other students: “We know what rational means - it means somebody who uses dispassionate logic and reason to make decisions. I did a survey among my Twitter followers and over 90% of them agree that people are not rational. Hashtag EconomistsSuck”. (Note: I don’t know if TikTok has hashtags).\nDisheartened, the Economics professor tries their final weapon. “Ok, I know you’pre not cons… I mean, c-words, you are people. Do you people want to learn how to make a lot of money in the stock market so that you can buy whatever you want?” Everybody gets real quiet.\nSpoiler alert: he’s going to tell them to invest in an index fund. Spoiler alert 2: they’ll buy crypto."

    "text": "You may have been taught to avoid emails that are full of errors and absurd claims (such a prince wanting your help). You may think that the fraudsters that use such emails are lazy or uneducated, and that the emails have errors because the fraudsters are not good at English. The truth is a lot more fun.\nWe start by assuming that the “fraudster”/“bad actor” is a profit maximizer, and that their cost per hour is $10. Let’s assume it costs $50 to create an email with errors, and $200 to craft an error-free email. They pay this cost only once.\nLet’s also assume that they can send that email for free to 1 million people, of which 10% (100,000) are “gullible” (easy to trick), and the remaining 900,000 are “skeptical” (hard to trick). When a potential victim responds, the bad actor has to invest some time with them to get their financial information. If they’re gullible, the bad actor has to invest 5 hours ($50) on average, and they get $1,000. If they’re skeptical, the bad actor will invest 10 hours on average to realize that they’re skeptical, and will get no financial information (profit = $0).\nThe email with errors gets a 2 out of 10 response from gullible people and no response from skeptical people. If the bad actor uses this email, the victim pool will have 20,000 gullible people. The well-crafted email gets a 8 out of 10 response from gullible people and a 1 out of 9 response from skeptical people. In this case, the victim pool will have 80,000 gullible and 90,000 skeptical people.\nAfter sending the e-mail, the bad actor has a 1,000-hour budget (that’s about 6 months of work) to work with the pool of respondents. When they choose a new potential victim from the pool of respondents, assume the draw is uniformly distributed over the proportions of the pool. That is, for the error-free email, they get a gullible person with probability 8/17 and a skeptical with probability 9/17. For the email with errors, it’s always a gullible person.\nWhich of the two emails should the bad actor send in order to maximize their profits?\nFollow-up: should the bad actor invest in an even better email that everyone (gullible and skeptical) responds to?\nIf you work through the example, you’ll find that the email with errors performs better, because it filters out time-wasting smart people. Real scammers use bad emails on purpose: only the very gullible will respond, making the scammer job easier."

    "section": "",
    "text": "While not a representative sample, most data scientists I know use MacOS. I have used MacOS at Amazon, but for most of my career, I have used Linux. Arch Linux. Yes… I use Arch, btw.\nArch has a fame of being difficult to install. That is not necessarily fair, since all one needs to do is to follow the installation instructions on the wonderful ArchWiki. The difficulty is that Arch would not make any choices for you: to install it, you needed to understand and choose things that most people just “take the default”. For example, network driver, disk filesystem, even your text editor. Yes, Arch won’t even install vi for you. Or a WiFi driver. The user needs to read and understand the Wiki really well, or things won’t work.\nFurthermore, once done with the installation instructions, a user has only a command-line interface system. If the user wants a graphical desktop environment they have to install it, which means making another choice, which means having to learn about all the options and think about them, which means more reading and time commitment.\n\nArch is like that for everything. The result is a system that only has software that the user needs and understands. Other Linux distributions like Ubuntu get users up and running with just a few clicks. Most decisions are made on behalf of the users. The default installation comes with a lot of stuff that is not needed nor understood. The user doesn’t need to care about all their options, so they don’t. Arch is better if you’re optimizing for those dimensions, but in many (most?) cases, it’s better to optimize for time and get something more user-friendly. I use Arch, btw.\n“I use Arch btw” is about users becoming so proud of being able to install their Arch systems that they can’t help telling everyone, finding ways to drop the hint even when it’s not a good time.\n\n\n\nThe major constraint of using Arch is that it has all the setbacks of a Linux desktop. It’s not great for gaming, although it’s getting much better. It misses some useful work software such as Microsoft Office. The alternatives (e.g., LibreOffice) are not that great for my use cases. For my work, I also need Visual Studio 2022, which is also not available. The solution was to install a Windows VM, but to use your computer for games, one would need to either dual-boot or have a different machine.\nRecently, I am trying a new approach: the Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2). Arch is not one of the default options, but it can be done. The advantage of using WSL2 instead of a VM is that WSL2 has a great user experience. It feels like having a Linux command-line system with a desktop environment (Windows) that can run commercial software. I think that this is what people like about MacOS.\nFor example, When I run my VS Code editor from the Arch CLI, it opens VS Code in #Windows 11. It saves the files to #Arch. I can render with #Quarto on Arch and upload the blog to #Github Pages using the shell commands I’m used to.\nThe only difference is that instead of having a VSCode window in KDE, it’s in Windows 11. I can do that while waiting for my jobs to run in Visual Studio and replying to my email in Outlook 365. I can create Power BIs from the CSVs that are on my Arch file system, because the WSL filesystem integrates well with Windows. It’s pretty great.\n\nI can even run XServer software on Windows. The most impressive thing is that I can still use CUDA in Arch and run models that take advantage of my laptop’s GPU, because the Windows Nvidia driver supports my Arch-based WSL2 installation.\n\n\n\nIs this really using Arch? Probably not. My audio works, my network configuration worked out of the box, I can even print. Someone who starts using Arch in WSL doesn’t have to go through the trouble of understanding and overcoming these issues. Maybe it’s an Arch-lite experience… like Manjaro?\n\nI think people worry too much about gatekeeping. You should use whatever makes you productive. I use Arch, btw."

    "text": "If you have been following the news for the last few years, you have seen how much the prevalence of misinformation, disinformation (intentional misinformation), and propaganda (intentional misinformation by state actors) has increased a lot. Most topics of interest online have a shocking proportion of misinformation: Ukraine, COVID, elections, etc.\nDetermining whether a news article is fake or not is a difficult problem for both people and computer models. This ACM survey paper (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3395046) gives a good idea about the state of the art around 2020. It is far from a solved problem.\nAs you would expect, computer scientists break difficult problems into parts, and even the subtasks for fake news detection are hard. A few examples of subtasks are detecting if the headline matches the content of the news, evaluating the reputation of who is sharing the news, evaluating the reputation of the news website, etc.\nFor this latter task, a product I have found to be useful is NewsGuard https://www.newsguardtech.com/. Although NewsGuard has been (in my opinion, fairly) criticized a few years ago for having a bias towards the left, it has been improving continuously. These days, I find it very helpful, especially since I study disinformation and fraud for a living, and therefore my browsing patterns are… atypical.\nIt helps that NewsGuard is free for users of Microsoft Edge. You can install a NewsGuard extension and it will show whether the site you are seeing is trustworthy. It will also integrate with Bing when used in Edge, and show a badge next to each result.\nIf you want to try it out, the following link has the instructions: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/newsguard-b28e453e-568c-4d57-98ef-c61056f99462. Note that it’s only free for Microsoft Edge, which is a great browser that runs in a number of platforms such as Linux, Mac, etc."

    "title": "What are you optimizing for?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is revisiting an earlier post from May about salaries in tech companies, especially after the recent layoffs.\nWhen I wrote that post, I had just left Amazon to come to Microsoft. I was discussing the argument that FAANGs and many other tech companies such as AirBnB, Uber, and #Twitter paid a lot better than Microsoft. The market was starting to cool down after being super hot for a couple of years. Other data scientists I knew were still getting very generous offers from tech companies. Back then, Microsoft was seen as having a compensation problem, such that just a week later, on May 16th 2022, Microsoft announced that it was increasing its compensation to retain employees.\nThe conversations around that time were usually like this: someone would tell me that they got an offer from a tech company for 50% more their current total compensation. Then they would boldly ask me if my recent Microsoft package was as big as theirs, and if I thought they should take the offer.\nMy answer is super boring: “compensation is important but it’s not the only thing, maybe you want to optimize for other things like job security, a mission that you believe in, work-life balance, etc.”\nAt around the time, I also started suggesting that people look at how much of their pay would be coming from stocks. It was a lot, in some cases as much as 80%. I would ask them if they were comfortable with taking all that risk. Most people were.\nFor my own example, when I left Amazon, about 40% of my compensation was salary and 60% stock. Before leaving, I sold my vested Amazon stock at a (split-adjusted) price of $177. Today’s (November 4th 2022) market price is $89, almost exactly half. That would have been a 30% pay cut for me. Of course this works both ways - had the price doubled instead of halved, I would have gotten a 60% increase on my total compensation.\nThe above is only considering compensation risk, but you can take even more risk. I know plenty of people that never sell their RSUs. Besides taking risk with their compensation, they are also taking risks with their wealth. When their company is doing well, stocks go up and both their compensation and wealth go up. But when the company is not doing well, they may lose their job at the exact time their wealth is taking a big hit.\nAs I got older, I got more risk averse. For the last 10+ years, I have religiously diversified from my RSUs using a 10b5-1 plan, which I implemented manually. These plans are becoming more mainstream: there’s a company called Candor that automates the RSU diversification process. Although I have myself never used their services, I am a regular reader of Niya Dragova’s newsletter and I have also talked to David Chouinard abut RSUs. It’s definitely worth checking them out."

I’m going to assume that it’s a crash test dummy, not an allusion to the recent acquisition of #Twitter. The problem I have is with the gears.\nYou see, if the person with the mustache and the red shirt turns the gear clockwise, this would push the other two gears to turn counter-clockwise. But these other two gears push each other in opposite directions.\nFor example, if “red” moves clockwise, it will push “green” to move counter-clockwise, which in turn pushes “blue” to move clockwise, which in turn pushes “red” to move counter-clockwise… but “red” was being pushed to move clockwise to begin with. This whole gear system is stuck: if someone tries to introduce any movement, the system works to stay firmly locked into place.\nI’m still trying to decide if this is a mistake. Maybe it’s just great art, a subtle criticism about #teamwork that the artist snuck in. Maybe they worked in a #toxic workplace, or had a lot of group projects in high school.\nIt’s in days like this that I realize how luck I’ve been in my career. The teams I worked in (and my current team, the AI for Good Lab) were always places that were simultaneously good at science and great places to work at.\nI hope you are as lucky as I am."

It is really hard to leave these platforms completely, so I’m not deleting my account. You may even be reading this on Twitter, because I’m also not changing the tool I use to cross-post between Twitter and LinkedIn.\nMy Twitter ride was great. For a long time it really sucked, but then I realized how to mute words and people and things got a lot better. After purging the bad content from my timeline, I found a really cool niche of data science on Twitter, and met wonderful people who helped me a lot in my career so far: Tanya Cashorali, James David Long, Jesse Mostipak, Gabriela de Queiroz, Casey Almond and Vicki Boykis.\nVicki has several posts that changed how I think about the world. The reason why I left facebook was because of Vicki’s post about the data facebook collects. I learned to be grateful about the privilege that entitled me to leave facebook due to her post about digital noise. If you’re reading this on LinkedIn, the links to her posts will not appear, you need to see this post in my blog.\nRight now, I’m trying Mastodon and it’s going super well. It took about a day for things to really catch up, but it did. Most of the people I followed on Twitter and LinkedIn already showed up. It’s glorious. If you are in Mastodon, come say hi.\nEven though Twitter is a dumpster fire right now, I think it will survive. I think the specialized niches that thrived on Twitter will leave to Mastodon, where there will be less noise. I think the “pop culture” aspect of Twitter will remain. The way I’m thinking of this is: I don’t expect a Kardashian to show up on Mastodon, and I don’t expect scientists to move back to Twitter. It’s probably for the best."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A lot of the Twitter public mistakes could be avoided by using the Chesteron’s fence concept.\nChesterton’s fence says that you should not tear down a fence until you know why it was put up in the first place. It is an exercise in humility. Sucessful managers struggle with this concept, because they are used to being right. When they get to a new field and see a fence they don’t understand, their first reaction is to tear it down.\nIn my own head, I imagine a field that is used seasonally for sheep. The new administrator of the region sees the fence but not the sheep, and instead of asking around, tears down the fence. When the sheep farmers come back and release the sheep expecting them to be contained by the fence, they will be in for a surprise. The administrator will also be surpised when they see the angry farmers.\nI don’t have any private knowledge about Twitter, I’m only using public data to see examples that apparently coult have been avoided by using Chesterton’s fence.\nThe easiest example was the 50% layoffs, because the decison was partially and awkwardly undone shortly afterwards. The horrible Slack messages saying that they’ll bring people back, do a knowledge transfer and fire them again show the callousness of the decision.\n\nAnother example was Elon’s “1000 poorly batched RPCs are slowing down Twitter”, and the public response by “sach @ the the hellsite”. It’s not impossible that Elon is correct, or at least partially correct. But the public back and forth is showing that his new management team is not taking time to talk to existing function owners to understand things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are there sheep everywhere?\nThe most worrying examples might be still in the works. For example, Twitter fired a large number of content moderators. Mike Masnick from Techdirt has a wonderful article showing why these people were hired. We may start seeing sheep everywhere soon.\nThe most important thing about Chesterton’s fence is not that one needs to keep the fence. They just need to understand why it was put up. In my career, I have seen many useless fences, but by understanding why they were put up, I was able to find a better solution for the problem they were solving, rather than just creating new ones."

Then there was the “Twitter for brands”, where companies like Steak-Umm could make themselves known by reaching directly to conumers. There was also the “Twitter for Government”: I got a lot of information about my local government from Twitter. And then there was the more niche Twitter subspaces, like #EconTwitter, #ScienceTwitter, #DataTwitter, where we formed professional commnunities. The latter was brilliant, I met many people that taught me a lot. I’ve learned of many useful papers and tools through the “professional” Twitter.\nI think the latter Twitter is mostly gone. Most of it seem to have gone to Mastodon. Predicting the future is hard, but I think this is going to stick: the professional conversations will happen on Mastodon. It’s hard to make a bet about whether the other Twitter audiences will survive. I actually think it will. Maybe it will have to compete heavily with Gab and Truth Social, and maybe it will continue to be relevant for consumers and brands even without having to compete with those. Given all the engineers leaving Twitter, it’s also very possible that it will stop working in such a way that everybody will just move away."

I’d be surprised if people who follow me (who are usually in technology) had any trouble with it. The problem I see the most is people thinking that Mastodon is a Twitter replacement and try to do Twitter things on it. There’s no “Quote Tweet” functionality, and there’s also no search. These are intentional. In any case, the search on Twitter sucked. On the positive side, there’s an edit button and you can follow hashtags.\nOn Mastodon, there are multiple servers, and the server you join makes a little difference. It is easier to see posts from people in the same server, and the moderation policies are also server-specific. Some servers might prevent you from seeing certain content that the server moderation team judges its harmful. On Twitter, if the moderation team decides some content is harmful, you’re out of luck. On Mastodon, you can just switch servers.\nRegardless of the server you join, you will be able to see posts of people in other servers, as long as your administrator team has not blocked them. It usually takes a lot for a server to be blocked. It’s just easier to see content from people in your server: you can see it even if you don’t follow them and even if none of the people you follow repost them. Seeing content from people in other servers is a little harder, but it’s still easy. You can see their content if you follow them directly, if one of the people you follow reposts it, or if people in your server have that content, although you need to go to a separate timeline, called the Federated timeline, to see it in this latter case.\nMost of the people I interacted with in a semi-professional capacity on Twitter made the move to Mastodon. The other options seem to be using Discord and Slack. I love both, but they tend to be more fragmented. I have the “people I know from Boston” Slack, the “people from Florida” Slack, the “people of a cool conference” Slack. Almost everyone on each of those is on Mastodon, so it works better as a place to hang out."

The relevance of my timeline increased substantially - I find most of the posts in my timeline interesting and insightful, which required a lot of muting and blocking on Twitter.\nMy personal preference would have been for LinkedIn to become what Mastodon is becoming, but I think people tend to be a little more “real” on Mastodon. Maybe it’s because LinkedIn allows giant posts like this one that makes it hard to engage. Maybe people want to take less risks on LinkedIn because it’s so linked to employment, which is one of its strengths.\nIn any case, I suggest giving Mastodon a try, I think you’ll like it."

    "text": "Step 3: Generate Images\nNow you are ready to generate images with Stable Diffusion. You just need to provide a text prompt as input. For example, the following code will generate an image of a “jedi schnauzer”:\nprompt = \"jedi schnauzer\"\nimage = pipeline(prompt=prompt, height=512, width=512, num_inference_steps=80, guidance_scale=7.5).images[0]\nThe pipeline method will return an image object that you can display or save as you wish. You can also customize some parameters of the generation process, such as the number of samples, the resolution, and the number of diffusion steps.

    "title": "The Experiment That Revealed Our Fear of Solitude",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2014, Dan Gilbert, a Harvard psychologist, conducted an experiment that revealed something disturbing about human nature: we would rather inflict pain on ourselves than be alone with our thoughts.\nThe experiment was simple. Participants were asked to sit alone in a room for 15 minutes with no distractions, except for a button that would deliver an electric shock. The catch? The participants were told that the shock would be painful.\nShockingly, 67% of men and 25% of women chose to shock themselves rather than be alone with their thoughts. Gilbert concluded that humans have a natural aversion to solitude and will go to great lengths to avoid it.\nThis experiment has important implications for our modern world, where we are constantly connected to technology and rarely have a moment of solitude. We may be addicted to the constant stimulation of our devices, as they provide a welcome distraction from the discomfort of being alone with our thoughts.\nBut why are we so afraid of solitude? Gilbert suggests that it may be due to our evolutionary history. Humans have always lived in groups, and being alone was often a sign of danger. Our brains may be wired to seek out social interaction as a way of ensuring our survival.\nHowever, in today’s world, being alone can be a source of creativity and self-reflection. It allows us to disconnect from the noise of the world and connect with our inner selves. The ability to be alone with our thoughts is essential for personal growth and development.\nSo, what can we do to overcome our fear of solitude? Gilbert suggests that we start small. Take a few minutes each day to disconnect from technology and be alone with your thoughts. Use this time to reflect on your goals, dreams, and aspirations. Embrace the discomfort of solitude and see it as an opportunity for growth.\nIn conclusion, Gilbert’s experiment is a powerful reminder of the importance of solitude in our lives. It is a reminder that we must learn to embrace the discomfort of being alone with our thoughts if we want to grow and thrive as individuals."

    "title": "Delegating more, this time to LLMs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In my career, I have worked as an individual contributor and as a manager. Now in the large language models (LLM) era, I have learned that the most important skill a programmer or analyst can develop is the ability to delegate tasks effectively.\nThe rise of LLMs has revolutionized the way we approach programming and analysis. These models have the ability to process vast amounts of data and generate insights that would be impossible for a human to quickly produce on their own. However, to fully leverage the power of LLMs, programmers and analysts must learn how to delegate tasks effectively to them.\nDelegating tasks to LLMs requires a deep understanding of the model’s capabilities and limitations. To obtain good results, like when you are a manager, you need to understand the capabilities of the resources you are working with, and you need to put effort into crafting the appropriate instructions. In the most recent versions of GPT, you can improve your ouput a lot by giving context to your requests, asking for reasoning, and giving examples of the output you want.\nA simple request like “write a blog post about delegation” will not yield good results. You need to give the model a lot of context, like “write a blog post about delegation, and explain why it is important for programmers and analysts to delegate tasks to LLMs, use the style of , be detailed in your arguments, use short paragraphs, include the word ‘cow’ somewhere near the end of the text”.\nEffective delegation also requires a high degree of trust in the LLM. Many programmers and analysts are used to doing everything themselves, and may be hesitant to cede control to a machine. However, by building a strong understanding of the model and its outputs, and by carefully selecting inputs and parameters, programmers and analysts can confidently delegate tasks to LLMs and focus their energies on higher-level tasks.\nOf course, part of the problem is that if you cede too much control, the word ‘cow’ may appear in your text unexpectedly. By being very explicit in your instructions, you can minimize the chance of surprises, and maximize the benefits of delegating tasks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Peltzman Effect is a well-established economic theory that explores the unanticipated consequences of safety regulations. Eminent economist Sam Peltzman introduced this theory in his 1975 paper “The Effects of Automobile Safety Regulation.” According to the theory, safety regulations implemented with the best intentions can potentially encourage risky behavior among individuals, thereby offsetting the intended safety benefits.\nThe Peltzman Effect argues that safety regulations often provide individuals with a false sense of security, leading them to engage in riskier behavior. For instance, drivers may become more reckless if their car has safety features such as airbags and seat belts. They may assume that they are protected in case of accidents and therefore, act negligently.\nMoreover, the Peltzman Effect suggests that the impact of safety regulations can vary significantly depending on the type of regulation. Although mandatory seat belt laws have reduced fatalities and injuries in car accidents, they have also resulted in an increase in the number of accidents. This phenomenon is an excellent example of the Peltzman Effect, where some of the intended safety benefits are offset by the increased risk-taking behavior of individuals.\nDespite some debate, the Peltzman Effect remains a crucial concept in economics. It highlights that policymakers must carefully consider the potential unintended consequences of regulations. Policymakers must aim to minimize any negative impacts on individuals and society by devising regulations that provide the intended safety benefits while discouraging risky behavior.\nNote 1: this post is part of a series of experiments I’m doing with generative AI. I’m trying to iteratively collaborate with text and image generators and create articles that are 50%-70% written by me and the edited/improved by AI generators (currently GPT-3.5-Turbo and Stable Diffusion 2.1). I am still not loving it but will upgrade to GPT-4 really soon.\nNote 2: If this worked, the “Disney Socialite” image I generated for this post is not wearning a seatbelt…"
