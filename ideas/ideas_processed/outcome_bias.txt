One of the most dangerous things in business is thinking that decisions that led to good outcomes are good decisions, and by extension, people who made decisions that led to good outcomes are good decision makers. We call that "outcome bias".

My favorite example of this comes from an academic article in the Quarterly Journal of Economics from 2001, "Are CEOs rewarded for luck?" (DOI: 10.1162/00335530152466269). In that article, the authors find that if the company doesn't have good governance principles, CEOs make as much money from actions under their control as they make from actions outside of their control (e.g., a war pushes up the price of oil). 

What can make these problem even worse is if people start thinking backwards: because CEOs were well rewarded, they are competent, when in fact it's possible they've just been lucky and are, in fact, not competent at all. Of course this happens all the time and not only to CEOs.

I have seen business that depend on the exchange rate create lots of geniuses when the exchange rate is favorable and the same people been fired for (assumed) incompetence when the exchange rate is unfavorable. 

Therefore, what we need is a framework that rewards people for decisions that are well-founded. This means that measurable risks are documented, expected outcomes and their probabilities are assessed (even if roughly) and then a decision is made with an understanding of its uncertainty. Managers that set up such a framework to make decisions should be rewarded, and you can measure manager's success in the same way one can measure the success of forecasters.
