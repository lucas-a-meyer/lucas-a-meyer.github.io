Five years ago, in 2018, Google announced an AI feature, called Google Duplex, that could call a restaurant or a salon and book an appointment for you. 

At that time, there was a lot of panicked responses, and a lot of concern about AI taking over the job of call centers or being used for social engineering.

A user review from a few months later revealed that the real user experience was not very good. It took about a minute and half to set up Duplex to make a call, which is on average more time than it takes to do a call yourself. A year later, still before COVID, Google revealed that at least 25% of the calls needed to fall back to human operators.

Then COVID came and for a while booking restaurants and haircuts was not top of the list.

Later, Duplex was integrated in the Pixel and in the Google Assistant. I'm not an Pixel or Google Assistant user, but I found a six-month old Reddit thread with mixed reviews about it... maybe the best summary was "great when it works".

We're now in the middle of a firehose of hype about large language models. Sometimes, you'll see really impressive demos of new technology. Don't Panic. Remember that the demos that you'll see are usually of cases in which the technology worked.

Knowing what I know today about large language models, I think it's possible to make something like Duplex work well, especially by incorporating some of the new technologies like chaining and goal-seeking. But five years ago, a demo made it seem that things were already working well enough. Looks like they weren't.

But the main takeaway is don't panic about the firehose of new releases. You don't need to learn everything right now. Whatever is really good will be around six months (or five years) from now.
