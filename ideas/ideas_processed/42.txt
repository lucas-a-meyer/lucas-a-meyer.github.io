I want to write about the number forty two. Why is it used so often in computer science?
Can you provide examples about it being used as a seed for random numbers?
How did Douglas Adams come up with it for the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy? 
Do people know that it also appears in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland? 
Do people know that Lewis Carroll is in reality a mathematication named Charles Lutwidge Dodgson?
