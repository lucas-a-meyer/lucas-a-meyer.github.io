The Microsoft Semantic Kernel is great for creating AI agents and chaining several functions together. Recently, OpenAI released a beta version of their Vision model, a model that can generate text from images. I created a plugin for the Semantic Kernel that allows you to use the OpenAI Vision model as part of your AI agent.

In this article, I'll explain how to use the plugin as part of a chain of functions: I'll use the vision plugin to identify an animal, and then use the result to ask OpenAI for three interesting facts about that animal. The code for this example can be found in the [demo.py](https://github.com/lucas-a-meyer/sk-vision-py/blob/main/demo.py) source file in the [GitHub repository](https://l.meyerperin.com/b_skvisionpy).

The plugin has a single function, `ApplyPromptToImage`, which takes a prompt and an image URL as input, and returns the generated text. The examples are also intentionally simple and intended just to get you started. The plugin can be used for more complex tasks, such as figuring out whether a street intersection is accessible to wheelchairs, or whether a person is wearing a mask. 

# Explaining why memes are funny

In this first example, I will use the plugin to explain why a meme is funny. The prompt is simply `Why is this meme funny?` 

```python
    
    kernel = sk.Kernel()
    vision = kernel.import_skill(Vision())

    meme_base_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucas-a-meyer/lucas-a-meyer.github.io/main/images/"
    meme_url_list = ["meme1.jpg", "meme2.png", "meme3.jpg"] 

    for url in meme_url_list:
        variables = sk.ContextVariables()
        variables['prompt'] = "Why is this meme funny?"
        variables['url'] = meme_base_url + url
        meme = await kernel.run_async(vision['ApplyPromptToImage'], input_vars=variables)
        print(f"{meme}\n\n")     
```

Here are the results, I think they are very good.

| Meme      | Explanation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|![](/images/meme2.png){width=300}| The humor in this meme comes from the irony and self-awareness of the situation. The person in the image is depicted as being awake at 3 AM, a time typically associated with sleep, while reading about the importance of sleep. The implication is that while they understand the value of sleep for health and well-being, they are not following this advice themselves. The relatable contradiction between what they're doing (staying up late) and what they're reading about (the importance of sleep) creates a humorous juxtaposition that many people can identify with, as it's common for individuals to do things that go against their own better judgment or knowledge.|
|![](/images/meme3.jpg){width=300} | This meme is humorous because it presents a situation where someone has comically circumvented a rule through a technicality. The text explains that while there's a rule against having pumpkins in their dormitory, there's no mention of pineapples. The images show a pineapple carved in a manner similar to a jack-o'-lantern, traditionally made from a pumpkin, often for Halloween. The humor arises from the person's literal interpretation of the rules, exploiting the lack of specificity to create a loophole and do something in the spirit of what's prohibited yet not technically against the rules. This kind of wit and playful rebellion against overly specific or seemingly arbitrary rules often resonates with people who enjoy clever ways to bend or skirt the rules without breaking them.|
|![](/images/meme1.jpg){width=300} | The humor in this meme arises from the juxtaposition of an inspirational saying typically found in areas of the home where food is prepared or consumed—like the kitchen—and placing it in a completely inappropriate context—the bathroom. Specifically, the framed quote says, "LIFE IS SHORT LICK THE BOWL," which in a culinary context encourages people to enjoy life to the fullest, perhaps by savoring every last bit of their food. However, when placed in the bathroom, right next to a toilet bowl, the phrase takes on a literal and unpleasantly comical meaning. The idea of licking a toilet bowl is both absurd and humorous, evoking a reaction due to the drastic shift in the context of the phrase.|

In the next section, I'll explain how to use the plugin to identify an animal in an image and pass the results to another function.

# Chaining the plugin answer to another function

In the example below, I first use the vision plugin to identify an animal, and then use the results to ask for three interesting facts about an animal. I have createad a semantic function with the prompt `Provide three interesting and unusual facts about the animal {{$input}}` and called it `AnimalFacts`. I then use the result of the vision plugin as the input for the `AnimalFacts` function.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why is this useful?

In my example, I'm using the Vision API in the call that identifies the animal from the image, but GPT-3.5 in the call that generates the facts, because the GPT-4 Vision API can be [expensive](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision/calculating-costs).
:::

```python

url = "https://l.meyerperin.com/skv_owl"
gpt35 = OpenAIChatCompletion("gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key, org_id)
kernel.add_chat_service("gpt35", gpt35)

vision = kernel.import_skill(Vision())
plugins = kernel.import_semantic_skill_from_directory(".", "plugins")

variables = sk.ContextVariables()
variables['prompt'] = "What animal is this? Please respond in one word."
variables['url'] = url

animal = await kernel.run_async(vision['ApplyPromptToImage'], input_vars=variables)
facts = await kernel.run_async(plugins['AnimalFacts'], input_str=str(animal))
print(f"The animal from the picture is a {animal}")  
print(f"{facts}\n\n")

```
Below are the results I learned about owls from the output of my AI agent:
```
1. Owls have specialized feathers with fringes of varying softness that help muffle 
sound when they fly. Their broad wings and light bodies also make them practically 
silent fliers, which helps them stalk prey more easily.

1. Unlike most birds, owls have both eyes facing forward which gives them better
 depth perception for hunting.

1. Some species of owls, such as the Great Gray Owl, can hear a mouse moving 
underneath a foot of snow from up to 60 feet away. Their ears are asymmetrical,
 with one ear being higher than the other, which helps them locate sounds in 
 multiple dimensions.
```

# Writing a native plugin to wrap the OpenAI API

The plugin is a native plugin, written in Python. The plugin code is in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lucas-a-meyer/sk-vision-py/blob/main/VisionPlugin.py). The code is very simple.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
from semantic_kernel.skill_definition import sk_function, sk_function_context_parameter
from semantic_kernel.orchestration.sk_context import SKContext
import os
```

We need to import the OpenAI library, the SKContext class because our function has multiple parameters (the prompt and the image URL), and the decorators that will allow us to make the Python function visible to the semantic Kernel.

```python
class Vision:
    @sk_function(
        description="""Asks the GPT-4 Vision API to perform an operation described by the prompt
        on an image given its url""",
        name="ApplyPromptToImage"
    )
    @sk_function_context_parameter(
        name="prompt",
        description="The prompt you want to send to the Vision API",
    )
    @sk_function_context_parameter(
        name="url",
        description="",
    )
```
The function is below and it simply sends a message to the OpenAI API and returns the response.


```python
        def ApplyPromptToImage(self, context: SKContext) -> str:
        load_dotenv()
        client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

        response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-vision-preview",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": f"{context['prompt']}"},
                {"type": "image_url","image_url": {"url": f"{context['url']}",
            },},],}],
        max_tokens=300,
        )

        return response.choices[0].message.content
```

# Have I ever thought about creating an app that does this as a service?

Yes, and with the blog post above, you can easily create one. It will probably take you less than an hour to get it working. The main challenge is to bill for it, as the Open AI Vision calls can get expenive very quickly.
