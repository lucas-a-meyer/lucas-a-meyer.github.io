title: Flunking a SQL interview with 20+ years of practice
twitter-posted: '2021-04-15'

I learned SQL in college in 1997. My first professional experience was MS SQL Server 6.5 in 1998.

I have written SQL almost daily for over 20 years. A few months ago, I flunked a SQL interview for a *manager* position. 

Interviewing is hard, be kind.
