    "title": "Badlands Ranch Dog Food Review",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThis is a review of Badlands Ranch, a dry dog food. I am not affiliated with the company in any way and I don’t receive any compensation for this review.\n\n\nOur dog, TheFuzzy, is very picky with food. She will go into hunger strikes for an extended period of time if she dislikes the food. The first brand that worked reliably for us was The Farmer’s Dog. The main drawback of that food is that it’s wet and frozen. It takes a fair amount of freezer space, the kids don’t like to handle it, it’s hard to travel with. We tried a few other brands, but none of them worked. Then we found Badlands Ranch, a dry food funded by the actress Katherine Heigl, and decided to give it a try.\nYou can order the food on their website. They run promotions that give big discounts on the first order, but they seem to run promotions giving big discounts all the time.\n\n\nHere’s a few things that you should know before you try that are not obvious from the website:\n\nThe packages are small, containing only 10 cups of food each. My dog is 40 lbs, and she needs 2.5 cups per day, so each package lasts only 4 days.\nThe food is expensive: if you buy the 6-bag bundle, it’s $203.70 for 60 cups, or $3.40 per cup. That’s $8.50 per day for my dog. Blue Buffalo food, a premium brand of wet food, is about $6.50 per day for my dog.\n\nHowever, my dog reliably likes it. Because it’s dry food, we can travel with it. It’s fairly calorie-dense, so it’s easy to carry a few days worth of food in a small bag. It’s also easy to store, and it doesn’t smell. The kids feed the dog without complaining, and the dog eats mostly without complaining, so it works well for us. Unless we’re eating pizza, in which case the dog will refuse to eat anything else. But you can’t blame her for that.\n\n\n\nSometimes Badlands Ranch runs big promotions for large orders - I recently ordered 12 packages for $312.80. That’s $2.60 per cup, or $6.50 per day for my dog, same as Blue Buffalo. They send you a large (and annoying) number of emails, so you’ll know when they run promotions, even if you don’t really want to."

    "text": "I started writing code when I was 9 years old. I ended up going to Law school. Maybe you should not follow my career path.\n\n\nI was never a great student. I got easily distracted. I could do extremely well if the subject interested me, but it frequently did not. Sometimes, some aspect of a subject interested me much more than what the academic program wanted from students. For example, when we were studying the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish in the 1500s, I really wanted to understand the science of sailing. My teacher wanted me to memorize dates. My saving grace was that I did well in tests, especially standardized tests. And in the country I’m from, Brazil, you can get into a good university if you do well in standardized tests.\n\n\n\nRealizing that, my family decided I was going to be a medical doctor. Back then, it was a pathway to riches in Brazil. My family’s thinking went like this: most people that want to be doctors can’t because they can’t get into medical school. Since presumably I could pass the test and get in, I got that idea drilled into me from a young age. I was going to be a doctor.\nIn a comic twist of fate, people in my family started fighting over an inheritance that was not very big (maybe equivalent to $100k USD today). People started getting divorced. They needed lawyers. The campaign to make me a lawyer started.\nUltimately, when I was 17, I needed to decide what career to pursue. I actually applied for Law, Medicine, and Engineering in the three top universities from my state. Maybe fate would decide where I was going to go. Fate had other plans: I got into all three. One of my friends wanted to be a lawyer, so I followed him.\n\n\n\nI hated law school. Not the school itself, but who I thought I needed to become in order to be a successful lawyer in Brazil in the early 2000s. At some point in the second year, we were asked to do a subject completely outside of Law. I took long to find one and only had slim pickings. I ended up doing Assembly programming. Not only did I love it, but I did super well. I quit Law school, did the standardized tests again, and got into Computer Science.\nI kept having the same problems I have always had as a student: in Computer Science, I was interested in databases, graph theory, and statistics, but not in compilers or linear algebra. I really loved abstract algebra and proofs, operating systems, and programming languages, but hated computer architecture. Again, not a great student, with some bright spots, enough to graduate.\n\n\n\nYou’d think this was the end of the story, but when I graduated, I found that it was very hard to find a job as a computer scientist in Brazil. I ended up working in Technical Sales, and I really did not like it, mostly because of the way the incentives for my position were set up. So I made a plan to move to the US. My company needed people to work in Finance, so I learned Finance and transferred to the US. When I could, I would transfer back to software engineering.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that transferring from Finance into software engineering was not easy. First, I needed to wait several years because of immigration restrictions. By the time I could change job families, I had been out of Computer Science school for a while. Interviews were today’s equivalent of Leetcode, but I had no practice. Also, I started to really like Finance: I was good at it. I went back to school to learn more Finance and get really, really good at it. At some point, I started thinking that going back into a software engineering position would not make me happy: I would have to go back a lot in my career to start again.\nI lucked out. Suddenly, there was this new thing called Data Science that required technical skills, statistics, and expertise in a subject-matter. Given my background, I could claim to have an expertise in Finance. Even though my department didn’t have a data science career, I started doing a lot of data science.\n\n\n\nIn American football, there’s this saying: “You are what your numbers say you are.” Even though I had worked in Finance for a decade and built some cool models where the Finance was the feature, not the tech, everybody saw me as a “tech person”. One day, I was in my kitchen talking to my sister-in-law, who works in Finance and had only known me as somebody who worked in Finance. At some point, she called me “a tech person”. It was then that I decided to embrace it. I started working hard to convert my position from Finance to engineering. At this point, I was lucky to have a visionary manager that supported that and enabled me (and I hope both of us) to be very successful.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese have a principle of career happiness called Ikigai: the best career is at the midpoint between four things: what you are good at, what the world needs, what can get you paid, and what makes you happy. For a decade, I had thought that going back to engineering would be a problem for either getting paid or making me happy, and I settled for being happy with Finance. It turns out that I could do a lot with Data Science, whether it was related to Finance or not. I ended up doing a lot of fun Data Science projects that I’m very proud of.\nAt this point in my career, I hired a career coach. I wish I had done that a lot sooner. She helped me document what was important to me. It was also during a period where the Data Science market was super hot and I had lots of competing offers (those were the days…). Knowing a little bit more about the impact I wanted to have in the world while still providing for the needs of my family helped me think about what I would love to have in a position. Again, I lucked out - among several competing offers, an old friend reached out with an opportunity that was a perfect fit for me.\n\n\n\nWhile I lucked out in some points of my career, I also had my share of bad luck. For one, immigration restrictions held me back. Sometimes, reorgs at work required me to prove myself all over again. Some personal things made me realize that you never know what someone is going through in life. You only see a small facet of what they choose to let on.\nBut maybe this whole experience was worthwhile. I’ve been exposed to a lot of things, and I have a great opportunity to help the world be a better place through my work. I’m not sure I would have gotten here if I had followed a more traditional path. In any case, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that I’m here now and that I can do it now.\n\n\n\nI don’t know what your Ikigai is. I know that sometimes you can get far off-path. I needed help to find my bearings. You shouldn’t follow my career path, as I was lost for a long time. But you can learn from my mistakes, and learn what you’re good at and what makes you happy sooner rather than later, and start driving towards that. I hope your road to happiness is shorter than mine, and that it has at least as many beautiful sights along the way."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have “quietly left” Twitter. I’ve configured my devices in a way that I can only see Twitter if I use a specific device, and that usually takes more effort that it’s worth. That’s also how I tamed several other digital habits.\n\nA few years ago, I used the same method to quit Facebook and its properties. It is really hard to leave these platforms completely, so I’m not deleting my account. You may even be reading this on Twitter, because I’m also not changing the tool I use to cross-post between Twitter and LinkedIn.\nMy Twitter ride was great. For a long time it really sucked, but then I realized how to mute words and people and things got a lot better. After purging the bad content from my timeline, I found a really cool niche of data science on Twitter, and met wonderful people who helped me a lot in my career so far: Tanya Cashorali, James David Long, Jesse Mostipak, Gabriela de Queiroz, Casey Almond and Vicki Boykis.\nVicki has several posts that changed how I think about the world. The reason why I left facebook was because of Vicki’s post about the data facebook collects. I learned to be grateful about the privilege that entitled me to leave facebook due to her post about digital noise. If you’re reading this on LinkedIn, the links to her posts will not appear, you need to see this post in my blog.\nRight now, I’m trying Mastodon and it’s going super well. It took about a day for things to really catch up, but it did. Most of the people I followed on Twitter and LinkedIn already showed up. It’s glorious. If you are in Mastodon, come say hi.\nEven though Twitter is a dumpster fire right now, I think it will survive. I think the specialized niches that thrived on Twitter will leave to Mastodon, where there will be less noise. I think the “pop culture” aspect of Twitter will remain. The way I’m thinking of this is: I don’t expect a Kardashian to show up on Mastodon, and I don’t expect scientists to move back to Twitter. It’s probably for the best."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is revisiting an earlier post from May about salaries in tech companies, especially after the recent layoffs.\nWhen I wrote that post, I had just left Amazon to come to Microsoft. I was discussing the argument that FAANGs and many other tech companies such as AirBnB, Uber, and #Twitter paid a lot better than Microsoft. The market was starting to cool down after being super hot for a couple of years. Other data scientists I knew were still getting very generous offers from tech companies. Back then, Microsoft was seen as having a compensation problem, such that just a week later, on May 16th 2022, Microsoft announced that it was increasing its compensation to retain employees.\nThe conversations around that time were usually like this: someone would tell me that they got an offer from a tech company for 50% more their current total compensation. Then they would boldly ask me if my recent Microsoft package was as big as theirs, and if I thought they should take the offer.\nMy answer is super boring: “compensation is important but it’s not the only thing, maybe you want to optimize for other things like job security, a mission that you believe in, work-life balance, etc.”\nAt around the time, I also started suggesting that people look at how much of their pay would be coming from stocks. It was a lot, in some cases as much as 80%. I would ask them if they were comfortable with taking all that risk. Most people were.\nFor my own example, when I left Amazon, about 40% of my compensation was salary and 60% stock. Before leaving, I sold my vested Amazon stock at a (split-adjusted) price of $177. Today’s (November 4th 2022) market price is $89, almost exactly half. That would have been a 30% pay cut for me. Of course this works both ways - had the price doubled instead of halved, I would have gotten a 60% increase on my total compensation.\nThe above is only considering compensation risk, but you can take even more risk. I know plenty of people that never sell their RSUs. Besides taking risk with their compensation, they are also taking risks with their wealth. When their company is doing well, stocks go up and both their compensation and wealth go up. But when the company is not doing well, they may lose their job at the exact time their wealth is taking a big hit.\nAs I got older, I got more risk averse. For the last 10+ years, I have religiously diversified from my RSUs using a 10b5-1 plan, which I implemented manually. These plans are becoming more mainstream: there’s a company called Candor that automates the RSU diversification process. Although I have myself never used their services, I am a regular reader of Niya Dragova’s newsletter and I have also talked to David Chouinard abut RSUs. It’s definitely worth checking them out."

    "section": "",
    "text": "While not a representative sample, most data scientists I know use MacOS. I have used MacOS at Amazon, but for most of my career, I have used Linux. Arch Linux. Yes… I use Arch, btw.\nArch has a fame of being difficult to install. That is not necessarily fair, since all one needs to do is to follow the installation instructions on the wonderful ArchWiki. The difficulty is that Arch would not make any choices for you: to install it, you needed to understand and choose things that most people just “take the default”. For example, network driver, disk filesystem, even your text editor. Yes, Arch won’t even install vi for you. Or a WiFi driver. The user needs to read and understand the Wiki really well, or things won’t work.\nFurthermore, once done with the installation instructions, a user has only a command-line interface system. If the user wants a graphical desktop environment they have to install it, which means making another choice, which means having to learn about all the options and think about them, which means more reading and time commitment.\n\nArch is like that for everything. The result is a system that only has software that the user needs and understands. Other Linux distributions like Ubuntu get users up and running with just a few clicks. Most decisions are made on behalf of the users. The default installation comes with a lot of stuff that is not needed nor understood. The user doesn’t need to care about all their options, so they don’t. Arch is better if you’re optimizing for those dimensions, but in many (most?) cases, it’s better to optimize for time and get something more user-friendly. I use Arch, btw.\n“I use Arch btw” is about users becoming so proud of being able to install their Arch systems that they can’t help telling everyone, finding ways to drop the hint even when it’s not a good time.\n\n\n\nThe major constraint of using Arch is that it has all the setbacks of a Linux desktop. It’s not great for gaming, although it’s getting much better. It misses some useful work software such as Microsoft Office. The alternatives (e.g., LibreOffice) are not that great for my use cases. For my work, I also need Visual Studio 2022, which is also not available. The solution was to install a Windows VM, but to use your computer for games, one would need to either dual-boot or have a different machine.\nRecently, I am trying a new approach: the Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ed Rice, one of my former Finance professors, was once telling me how teaching Economics is different from teaching Physics.\nNot exactly about how the science differs, but about how people react when being taught.\nFor example, a Physics professor walks into a lecture hall, puts some formulas on the whiteboard and states: “let’s assume we’re in a vacuum and all surfaces are frictionless”. Students obediently copy the formulas and start working with them, learning about the interactions between their terms. They soon start imagining their applicability in the real world, where these conditions don’t hold.\nAn Economics professor walks into a lecture hall, puts some formulas on the whiteboard and states: “let’s assume consumers have rational preferences, which are defined as…”. Ten students storm out of the lecture hall. Two students start crying. A more outspoken student yells from the back: “Surely people aren’t rational!”\nThe professor tries to explain: “you know, rational preferences mean…” Another student chimes in: “Rational? Are you even watching the news? Half the people in this country aren’t rational”. All students agree, not immediately realizing that they would disagree about which half.\nA student wearing a designer Burberry t-shirt steps up: “Why are you implying that we’re all consumers? That’s predatory capitalism. Consumers is a no-no word, and from now on, please just refer to it as the c-word!”, while recording the interaction in their Swarovski encrusted iPhone for their TikTok followers.\nAt this very moment, the Physics professor steps into the Economics lecture hall: “Hey, you are being too noisy and disturbing my class. We’re doing science next door, can you please be quieter?” This helps. People start to calm down.\nThe Economics professor takes a deep breath. “As I was trying to explain, in Economics, rational preferences mean…”, but Burberry interrupts again, to the general agreement of other students: “We know what rational means - it means somebody who uses dispassionate logic and reason to make decisions. I did a survey among my Twitter followers and over 90% of them agree that people are not rational. Hashtag EconomistsSuck”. (Note: I don’t know if TikTok has hashtags).\nDisheartened, the Economics professor tries their final weapon. “Ok, I know you’pre not cons… I mean, c-words, you are people. Do you people want to learn how to make a lot of money in the stock market so that you can buy whatever you want?” Everybody gets real quiet.\nSpoiler alert: he’s going to tell them to invest in an index fund. Spoiler alert 2: they’ll buy crypto."

    "text": "If you’re a data scientist, you’re probably very much used to wait for model training results.\nSometimes I wait for so long that I forget to check back. To help me with that, I wrote a tiny script that uses Twilio to text me when my model is done training.\nTwilio is inexpensive. At the time I’m writing this, it costs $1 per month for a phone number. You can also use your own phone number for 50 cents per month, but I didn’t try that yet. Each text costs less than 1 cent. Even in a month when I am getting lots of notifications, I usually spend less than $2.\nAfter importing the library, the code to send an update is an one-liner:\nclient.api.account.messages.create(to=, from_=, body=“Training done!”)\nHere’s a simple example of how this already saved me time. During the development of a model, I frequently do something like a LIMIT(1000) in my data to make sure the whole program (inputs, outputs, diagnostics) is working before running the model on the full data. I thought I was ready to go and kicked off the model, closed my computer and was going out for the day, without knowing that I had forgotten to remove the LIMIT(1000). Almost immediately, I got a text telling me that training was complete. I logged back in, removed the LIMIT(1000) from the data acquisition, and kicked off the training again.\nIf I didn’t receive the text, I would realize what happened only on the day after, and would have to wait for the model to run instead of simply starting my next day analyzing the results.\nThat’s pretty good value for one line."

    "text": "Moved to Badlands Ranch Dog Food\n\n\n\nAs of November 2023, we have moved to Badlands Ranch Dog Food.\n\n\nThe review below is about The Farmer’s Dog, which we used for over a year. In November 2023, we moved to Badlands Ranch dog food, which ended up being a lot more convenient for about the same price, and similarly appreciated by my dog.\nI did not receive any compensation for this review, and I’m not affiliated with Badlands Ranch or The Farmer’s Dog in any way.\nIf you want to read my earlier review of the Farmer’s Dog, read on. My new review of Badlands Ranch is here.\n\nI recently subscribed to the Farmer’s Dog. I love it, even though I didn’t expect to.\n\n\nMy dog, TheFuzzy, is a standard schnauzer. She is very picky with her food, and would do very long hunger strikes to prove her point. She doesn’t like dry food, and we have been feeding her wet food for a while. Even so, she resists: if she sees us eating human food, she will want to participate. To address that, we needed to feed her before we start cooking for ourselves, or she would “protest” with a hunger strike.\n\n\n\n\nOne day, I was listening to a Freakonomics podcast on venture capital. In that episode, they interviewed Jonathan Regev, the founder of the Farmer’s Dog who talked about how hard it would have been for their company to scale without venture capital. I was, at that very moment, about to feed my dog, and decided to give it a try.\n\n\n\nSigning up to the Farmer’s Dog, as expected from something backed by VC, was very easy. I had to answer a (cute) questionnaire asking about my dog, her weight, and her food preferences. The result was a recommended food plan with a calculated number of calories, and a discounted price for a few weeks (I don’t remember if it was two or three).\n\n\n\nThe first thing I didn’t like was that the number of calories was on the low side. Using another web calculator, I found that my dog would need 946kcal/day. The Farmer’s Dog calculator gave me less than 500kcal/day, about half of what I thought I needed, and about half of what I was currently feeding her.\nThe second thing was the price: after removing the initial discount, the price was about the same of the food I was currently using… but for half the calories.\nThe next thing was my own fault: I was counting on using the food right away, but it arrives deeply frozen, and I needed to wait about 36h for it to unfreeze. The package was a little unwieldy: the food comes as a paste in sealed plastic bag. I needed to use scissors to cut the top of the package and press out the paste into the bowl. It is hard to measure the exact quantity, and easy to get one’s hand dirty, which makes it harder to convince my kids to do it. Measuring the right amount is also tricky.\nThe food needs to be frozen, defrosted and kept refrigerated. That makes it inconvenient to use it in travel.\nDid I hate it? For the first few days I thought I would, but…\n\n\n\nThe Farmer’s Dog excels where it matters: the dog eats the food like there’s no tomorrow. I wouldn’t even need to clean the bowl. The only other case when I see her eating like that when she’s eating human food. Being a careful scientist, I thought this could be because she was hungry due to the lower calories, but I tested that she devours the food even after getting a lot of calories from other foods in prior meals. She really likes the food. I think it’s a staple of VC investments that they want to sell solutions rather than products, and this solved my main problem.\nThe downside: I had to adjust the calorie count up, which meant that the Farmer’s Dog is now more expensive than my previous food.\n\n\n\nMy final verdict: I think it’s worthwhile giving it a try."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have recently announced that I’m leaving Amazon and starting a new job (yet to be announced) next week. This means that I have been on the interviewee side of the interview process somewhat recently.\nOne of the most important things to know is that the way of getting better at interviewing is… well, interviewing! It’s good to be on both sides of the table, both as an interviewer and as an interviewee. Practice helps you to do better, but it also helps you see where you’re not doing well.\nI have two policies about interviewing. The first policy is that I will accept an invitation to interview at least once a year, even if I’m happy with my job, which I frequently am. I don’t like wasting people’s time, so it has to be a place that I would really consider going to if the process worked out. The reason for that policy is that I once spent many years without interviewing and when a good opportunity showed up, I was very out of practice, and I think a lot of me not getting it was because I barely understood how the process worked in other companies. I’m not sure I’ll keep this policy.\nThe second policy, which I’m even less sure of its helpfulness, is that once I decide that I’m willing to change jobs, I will be fairly open to interview for lots of different things. For example, if I get invited to interview for my dream job and decide that I would leave my current job for it, I’ll interview for lots of other jobs as well. This gives me a lot of extra work and stress (interviewing is hard), but it also allows me to practice a lot and find my weaker spots, and to have a backup in case things don’t work out.\nOne of the hardest questions for me is “why do you want to leave your current job and join us”. I tend to like the job I have, and also tend to be more forthcoming than the average interviewee. My sincere answer is usually far away from “this is my dream job”. It’s possible that I have only succeeded in my latest interview because it’s a place that I really, really, really love and admire in a company that I love and admire, too. It was sincerely my dream job and team. In any case, after some practice in interviews (and lots of help from Katie Baird, PCC) I started to get better at answering that question, while still being sincere, which led to far more offers/quasi-offers.\nTo wrap this up, I want to recognize that my experience above is one of extreme privilege: I have been around for a long time, and I’m extremely fortunate to be invited to interview. A large number of people are in earlier stages, when even getting an interview is hard. If you are in that situation, I think the takeaway is to still try to get as much practice as you can (by being open even after you’re far into some process, by doing mock interviews in both sides of the table, etc.). I hope your time will come and I hope that I can help."

    "text": "One of my superpowers from my #Amazon review process this year was “Hire and Develop the Best”.\nThis may be because a few years ago, my (then) manager taught me a trick: when in doubt, err on the side of hiring people.\nI looked at my statistics a while back and I really don’t say “yes” that much more than my peers. It’s just a little more. When I shadowed other interviewers, I noticed that my questions are just as hard, if not harder. If I noticed one difference, it’s that I tend to start with a quick, easier question, which usually cost me less than five minutes, and I’m then quickly at or above the average difficulty level of my peer interviewers.\nI do this because it is extremely common for the interviewee to be nervous during an interview. Like on the movie Gladiator, you don’t know what will come out when the gates open, even though you prepared a lot for it. If the first question throws the interviewee off, it’s often hard for them to regain confidence. It’s quicksand.\n\nI like #interview questions that are “adaptive”, like the GMAT, meaning that you can make them easier or harder by changing small things. Sometimes, people would actually be able to do the hard version of the question, but they’re nervous and need to start with the easy one.\nAs commonplace as it is, the interview process is very imperfect, and usually tends to yield false negatives: meaning that it fails people that would have succeeded. Given how hard the process is, people that are “on the margin” are more likely to be good hires than not. I have not regretted any bets I’ve made."

    "text": "Chesterton’s Fence is an extremely important concept, especially if you are joining a new team in a senior or in a leadership position.\nThe concept dates from around 1929. The original text is longer, but a concise version is: “Do not take a fence down if you don’t know why it was put up in the first place.”\nNew managers and senior resources frequently want to change a lot of things. We are, after all, hired because of our deep expertise and experience. It’s not uncommon for a senior, experienced person to think that what was done before them was “wrong” and that they could easily do what’s “right”.\nThe reality is that, most times, whomever did the previous version is an accomplished professional had to make lots of decisions under constrained resources. I find that it’s usually hubris from my side to think that I can easily understand and solve all those problems quicker and better than they did. Fences don’t sprout from the ground - there’s a reason why a specific fence was put up there in the first place.\nI frequently learn a lot when trying to understand the reasons why the original decisions were made. Occasionally, the original solution can really be improved on, but after understanding why it was made in the first place I also learn of constraints I didn’t know. In many other cases, I learn of constraints that would actually create significant problems for the new idea I had, and that saves me and everyone else significant time.\nWhen I was less experienced and less careful, I brought down plenty of fences unnecessarily, and was later surprised to find escaped sheep on the road and farmers yelling at me.\nI also posted about other concepts, such as the XY Problem and Cunningham’s Law. I even keep a list of my favorite concepts!"

    "text": "Cunningham’s Law states “the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer.”\nIt’s not only applicable to the internet. I find that it works in a lot of other interactions, including work interactions.\nCunningham’s Law is frequently presented as a way to exploit a bias that people potentially have against “things being wrong”. While the “bias exploitation” story may be true, there’s also an economic reason why using Cunningham’s Law is a nice thing to do.\nA common example of when posting the wrong answer is expected is in Stack Overflow: when asking your question, it’s a good practice to show what you already tried and what’s not working (essentially posting the wrong answer).\nThe advantage of such a protocol is that it makes it easier on the people trying to help. Consider the example “Who is Luke’s father?”. Asked as a question, there’s a lot of context missing: Luke the Apostle? Luke Skywalker? Luke Wilson? My neighbor Luke?\nOn the other hand, the incorrect statement “Han Solo is Luke’s father” provides a lot of additional context: this is about Star Wars, and it also provides how the question asker expects the answer to look like. Economically, it lowers the production cost of an answer, making it easier to get one.\n… and if there’s something wrong with my theory above, I’m sure someone is going to correct me!"

One of the key points is to develop your personal brand. If you drop the ball a lot, say you will do things but don’t and are just a pain to work with, you will get that reputation, and that can follow you around. If you consistently deliver, are helpful and everybody knows it, that also tends to follow you around.\nThe tech market is simultaneously surprisingly large (sometimes you don’t know people in your own company) and surprisingly small (someone you knew a decade ago reaches out with a new opportunity). As your career grows longer, the probability of knowing someone and being known increases.\nAlso, being kind to people goes a long way, regardless of where you are in your career."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During a recent presentation, I’ve been asked: “What do you wish new hires knew?”\nTo me, the answer is “the XY problem”, or “how to properly ask technical questions”.\nThe classic guide for asking technical questions can be found on the web, but the most important part for me is the “XY Problem”.\nThe common mistake is to ask “how can I do X to solve Y”. The “to solve Y” part is frequently omitted, wasting time for everyone.\nLet me do an example to illustrate the problem. Jay is a new hire, recently hired from a prestigious school, to be the data analyst for a Finance team in a big tech company. The fiscal year is ending, and the company’s accountant asks Jay for a report that aggregates tax expenses by country. Jay recently used pandas in Jupyter for a different project, and the graphs that the accountant wants are similar to what Jay just did. Jay decides to ask “How can I connect a Jupyter notebook to the corporate database?”, so that Jay can use pandas to do fulfill the accountant’s request. When asking for help, Jay didn’t state why they want to connect their Jupyter notebook to the corporate database\nWhat Jay doesn’t know (and the accountant also doesn’t know) is that a Power BI report that does what the accountant needs already exists, and everybody in Finance has access to it.\nPeople spend time helping Jay connect to the corporate database. Jay spends time getting permissions, installing and configuring packages, etc. to solve a problem that was already solved. All this time is invested in something that is unnecessary, instead of being invested in improving the onboarding experience and documentation so that Jay and the accountant could learn that the report they needed already existed.\nDon’t be like Jay! State the problem you’re trying to solve, rather than asking for help with a specific task. You may learn a lot more.\nI love shortcuts such as “the XY problem” to explain complex concepts. I have a list in my blog."

We would then share these around the team.\nFor me, the debits were: - scheduling a meeting without looking at my free/busy - scheduling a meeting with me outside of work hours and canceling it last minute - surprising me with an urgent deliverable request\nAnd the credits were: - being efficient in meetings: having an agenda, pre-reads, action items - giving me visibility of projects I might be involved in at some point in the future - giving me feedback on how I could do things better\nIt was also helpful to learn about things that annoyed my colleagues that I did without realizing."

    "text": "As of June 2021, I manage a technical team at Amazon, and I have some positions open. And when you have a position open, it’s pretty standard to post it to LinkedIn.\nHere’s an overview of the process that job applications go through:\nCandidate Pool -&gt; Deduplication -&gt; CV Review -&gt; Technical Phone Screen -&gt; On-site interview -&gt; Offer -&gt; Offer Accepted.\n\n\nThe candidate pool is intentionally very broad, and as such, it’s easier to describe who is not in the talent pool:\n\nPeople outside of the position’s geographic area. For large companies, the geographic area can mean a whole country. This also usually means that international candidates can’t be considered. Some positions are more restricted, for example, requiring a specific city.\nPeople without the basic qualifications. In many companies, positions will have both basic and preferred qualifications listed. Read them - if you meet the basic qualifications, you’re fine. If you don’t meet the basic qualifications, you’ll get “desk rejected” and won’t even be considered. The best next step is to consider other positions - this will save you (and everyone) time.\nPeople who are already in an active application process with the company (more details in the “deduplication” step below).\n\nIf the exclusions above don’t apply to you, you’re in the candidate pool and should apply to the position using the process posted by the hiring manager or recruiter.\n\nIn large companies, it’s usually better to apply rather than ask whether you should apply. Large companies have processes, and if you wait to apply until the hiring manager replies (if they ever do), you may start at a disadvantage.\n\n\n \n\nAlso, in large companies, the candidate pool also includes applicants that didn’t get selected to other positions. This will be important in the “CV Review” step.\n\n\n\nOnce you apply to a position, the first group that sees your position is the recruiting team. You should not be surprised that their goal is the same as the hiring manager’s: they want to get to the “offer accepted” stage.\nThe first thing they do is to check if you’re not already in an active process with another recruiter. If you are, they’re going to let that process finish first, and you would probably be better served by waiting until that process ends before applying.\nRecruiters manage multiple positions and hundreds of candidates, and it’s hard to keep track of complex details for everyone, such as when to contact you back in case you fail one of your 20 attempts. Recruiters do an incredibly good job of keeping track of candidates, and succeed at superhuman levels, but you can help yourself by focusing on one position at a time.\nI am not sure whether applying to multiple positions in the same company simultaneously works well. One advantage is that it may get you started early - if two teams have open positions but one is very busy, the other may get started sooner. The other is that in case you fail at one process, you have a clear backup plan communicated to your recruiter through your other applications. However, there are other ways of communicating the same information, such as “just telling them”, or applying to your second choice after you fail the first.\nThere are also downsides of multiple applications in the same company: I have seen hiring managers (not necessarily from the companies I worked at) complaining to me about candidates with many applications: “they don’t know what they want or what they’re good at”. Another downside is that your first process can be one that you’re particularly poorly-suited to. You can fail so bad that you actually don’t qualify to apply for any positions for a period of time.\nIn summary, I would personally suggest that you don’t apply to multiple positions in the same company at the same time, unless you really know what you’re doing.\nIf you are not applying to multiple positions and you have not recently been rejected, we move to the next step.\n\n\n\nAt this point, a recruiter will look into your CV and check it matches the basic qualifications. If it does, the recruiter will likely also “stack rank” your CV against the CVs of other candidates that are already in the process. Remember, the goal is to get a candidate to “offer accepted”.\nFor example, if you have a really strong CV that exceeds all the basic and preferred qualifications and is also better than all other candidates at this point, you’ll likely move to the phone screen phase right away. On the other hand, if there is already a large number of candidates in further stages and your CV barely meets the basic qualifications, you’ll probably sit in a queue for a while.\n\nIf you ask for the hiring manager to review your CV and wait for their response before applying, you may be losing valuable time.\n\n\n \n\nIn large companies, there’s no way for the hiring manager to know how your CV stacks compared to all the other applicants, as many applicants are people who didn’t get selected for other positions (those are sometimes called “recycled applications”), or people who applied through channels other than LinkedIn. These are initially seen only by the recruiters.\nWhen you ask for the hiring manager to review your CV, they usually cannot do a better job than the recruiter would have done. It’s better to apply to the position and get to the recruiter faster. This may be different if you actually know the hiring manager (e.g., you worked together). In this case, it can work to your benefit to let the hiring manager know that you’re applying, but I would still apply first and let them know afterwards.\nIn most companies, the recruiter and hiring manager can see the results of your past applications and details about your past phone screens and on-site interviews at this point. It’s best to be truthful.\n\n\n\nIf you got here, you’ve got pretty far.\nIn many large companies, the recruiter will offer you some coaching on how to succeed at this stage. Don’t be shy about asking for help at this point. You will also find a lot of resources online to interview. For Amazon, it’s important to know the Leadership Principles. You should also check other sites for interview tips, such as Glassdoor and Blind.\nIn behavioral questions, it’s useful to structure your answer in a way that gives a lot of information to the interviewer in a short amount of time. Amazon prefers a method called STAR, which is described in this web page. I find that method to be useful to when interviewing for other companies as well.\nIf you’re interviewing for a technical position, besides a behavioral question, at this point you will be asked to solve a technical problem. In most cases, this will usually be something equivalent to a Leetcode “hard easy” or “easy medium”. If the position that you’re interviewing for is a senior position, the question may be considerably harder.\nThere are a lot of books and sites talking about how to prepare for a phone screen. The most famous one is Cracking the Code Interview. You should prepare the best you can for the phone screen. You should prepare even more if you see that your phone screen is with the hiring manager.\nIt’s not hard to fail phone screens. I have failed phone screens. I have programmed in SQL for 20+ years, and I have failed SQL phone screens. In a recent phone screen, an interviewer asked about MVC models (Model-View-Controller) and the interviewee answered about NBCs (Naive Bayes’ Classifiers) because the sound quality of the call was not so good. That could have been a disaster, but both interviewer and interviewee realized that something was wrong and recovered.\nIn most processes, the phone screen is pass/recycle/fail, instead of just pass/fail. If you don’t pass but you got close, you may get recycled to the “CV Review” phase of a similar position. When hiring managers are hiring for multiple positions (for example, SDE I and SDE II), if you fail the “higher” phone screen (e.g., SDE II) you can still be recycled for the “lower” (e.g. SDE I) phone screen and proceed to the next phase.\nFinally, hiring managers band together, because hiring managers need a lot of experienced interviewers for the on-site interview. If you barely fail a phone screen with one hiring manager but would have passed the phone screen for a different position with with another hiring manager (that would mean a different position or a lower level position), it’s possible that he will refer you to another hiring manager.\n\n\n\nIf you get here, you’re very close. At this point, the hiring manager and the recruiter will be excited about your prospects. The recruiter is likely to offer you some help and point you to some interview resources. Be sure to pay attention to the recruiter - they are on your side.\nIn all companies that I have worked for or with, when you get to the on-site interview we are hiring for the company, not for the position. We will bring your potential future internal clients to the loop. We will bring your potential future colleagues to the loop. Your hiring manager will be in the loop. These are likely the people that will work with you day in and day out.\nMost technical interview loops are a combination of behavioral and technical interviews. The balance may vary substantially. You should be prepared for at least 40% of technical interviews, although it could be as much as 80%. The remainder will be about behavioral questions. Remember to follow the STAR method to answer questions. This will serve you well even if you’re not interviewing for Amazon.\nIt is extremely rare for a candidate to ace all interviews in a loop. Don’t be discouraged if you gave less than perfect answers a couple times. The outcome will be decided based on the opinions of all interviewers. In my (long) career, I’ve seen many loops in which the decision to hire was not unanimous and even some cases when the opinion was far from unanimous and the person still got hired and did well. Usually, the opinion of the most senior person in the loop weighs more.\nOffer If you got here, congratulations. We think you’re a good fit and want you to be a bigger part of our lives!\nMost companies have somewhat strict offer ranges for their positions and levels. That’s less true about very high levels (ranges tend to be broad), but very common for lower levels (ranges tend to be narrow). The vast majority of offers will start in the midpoint of that strict range.\nCompanies want to make an offer that a candidate will accept, because they want a candidate they liked to start sooner rather than later. I have heard about “low ball” offers inviting negotiation (especially on Blind), but I have never personally seen one.\nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t negotiate. If you don’t like the offer, you should certainly negotiate. If you don’t like the offer even after the negotiation, it’s time to decline and walk away. I have done this several times in my life and even regretted a few, but in general, it’s for the best.\nThat also doesn’t mean that you should always negotiate. Companies want you to accept offers and be happy you did, so it’s not uncommon for the first offer to be really good. If you are already happy, there’s some risk in negotiating. It’s important to be careful to not be final when negotiating, especially for small amounts. You don’t want to risk painting yourself in a corner for a very small potential gain.\nFor example, if you currently have a total compensation of $160k and are offered $199k (which you secretly love), it would be unproductive to go to a position of “it’s either $203k or I walk away”. That small difference may put you out of the range (e.g., the range may be 160k-200k), and even if you receive a counter of $200k (the maximum that can be offered for that position) you may feel like you have to walk away because your demands have not been met. When walking into a negotiation, know what you want, be firm but flexible. And if you love the first offer, take it. Remember that every week you delay your start can cost you approximately 2% of your first year’s salary: a year has 52 weeks.\n\n\n\nIf you got here, you are probably very happy. A lot of other people will also be happy: the hiring manager, the recruiter, your new colleagues, your new internal clients.\nTake a break (interviewing is hard) and start preparing to enjoy your new job!\nThis post reflects my experience interviewing both as a hiring manager and a candidate for several positions in the last couple of decades. It’s not specific about my current or past employers. As of the writing of this post, I work for Amazon."

The vast majority of offers will start in the midpoint of that strict range.\nCompanies want to make an offer that a candidate will accept, because they want a candidate they liked to start sooner rather than later. I have heard about “low ball” offers inviting negotiation (especially on Blind), but I have never personally seen one.\nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t negotiate. If you don’t like the offer, you should certainly negotiate. If you don’t like the offer even after the negotiation, it’s time to decline and walk away. I have done this several times in my life and even regretted a few, but in general, it’s for the best.\nThat also doesn’t mean that you should always negotiate. Companies want you to accept offers and be happy you did, so it’s not uncommon for the first offer to be really good. If you are already happy, there’s some risk in negotiating. It’s important to be careful to not be final when negotiating, especially for small amounts. You don’t want to risk painting yourself in a corner for a very small potential gain.\nFor example, if you currently have a total compensation of $160k and are offered $199k (which you secretly love), it would be unproductive to go to a position of “it’s either $203k or I walk away”. That small difference may put you out of the range (e.g., the range may be 160k-200k), and even if you receive a counter of $200k (the maximum that can be offered for that position) you may feel like you have to walk away because your demands have not been met. When walking into a negotiation, know what you want, be firm but flexible. And if you love the first offer, take it. Remember that every week you delay your start can cost you approximately 2% of your first year’s salary: a year has 52 weeks."

    "text": "I learned SQL in college in 1997. My first professional experience was MS SQL Server 6.5 in 1998.\nI have written SQL almost daily for over 20 years. A few years ago, I flunked a SQL interview for a manager position.\nThe problem was that it had been too many years since my last interview. I didn’t know anything about interviewing recently, like, for example, the remote CoderPad. Even though I was prepared for the non-technical parts of the interview, since I had not done a technical interview for long, I was nervous. Not knowing how things worked made me more nervous.\nSince then, I have always volunteered to be an interviewer. I have occasionally interviewed “just in case”. That helped, and when the perfect job appeared for me, I was ready."

    "text": "YoStroop is a bot that allows members of a slack channel to give rewards to each other, usually as a way of saying “thank you” for help and valuable contributions.\nIt was developed using Python, Azure Functions v2.0 and Cosmos DB.\n\n\nOne of the Data Science Slack channels I’m a member of tried several different tools to keep track of the valuable contributions of its members. Some of the tools that we used to to track contributions became quite expensive and we started looking for an alternative. Since most people in the channel can program in R and Python, I thought we might develop our own Slack bot. Developing a Slack Bot is really straightforward. You essentially need a HTTP server that will receive JSONs and call Web APIs. I wanted to create a Slack bot that was:\n\nWritten in a language that most Data Scientists are familiar with (e.g. Python or R)\nVirtually free to run\nServerless\nBased on very well known technologies (e.g., pyodbc for databases)\nEasy to modify from GitHub with no hassle\nDeveloped and maintained in any major platform: Windows, macOS or Linux\n\nI have failed to achieve almost all of the goals above, but maybe will achieve most in the near future.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft recently released a Python worker for the Azure Functions runtime v2. As of this writing (2018-08-23), both Azure Functions v2 and the python worker are in “preview mode”. The Azure Functions v1 runtime supports development and hosting only in the portal or on Windows. The v2 runtime runs on .NET Core, and therefore can run on Windows, macOS and Linux. Microsoft provides a set of tools based on Node.JS and .NET Core that make it easy to develop in any platform. That takes care of objectives #1, #3 and #6. Although knocking off three objectives simply by selecting Azure Functions v2 sounded very promising to begin with, that’s as many objectives as I could achieve.\n\n\nRegardless of the platform you develop on, Python function apps need to be hosted on Azure Functions on Linux. Running on Linux has a couple downsides:\n\nYou have to access the Azure Portal using a secret code to enable Azure to offer Linux hosts\nAs of this writing (2018-08-23), Linux hosts can only be dedicated. Azure Functions can normally run in two modes: “Consumption” and “Dedicated”. Consumption is virtually free, but the “dedicated” mode costs approximately $35 per month for the cheapest version. According to the README the “Consumption” mode is upcoming, and I have a small allowance due to my MSDN subscription, so I caved.\n\nAnd there goes objective #2. But it seems temporary, so we’re probably good.\n\n\n\nA Slack bot is essentially an HTTP server that will receive JSONs and perform actions through HTTP requests. Azure Functions have an HTTP Trigger template, so this takes care of most of the plumbing. I created a Slack app using the instructions here. This bot subscribes to events, which are sent to an URL. I’ve created the HTTP Server that provides that URL using the instructions on how to create a function using the command line interface, and creating a sample based on the HttpTrigger.\nSpecifically, my Azure Function receives JSONs for each message, parses them to see if they have a :stroopwafel:, and if they do, parses the mentions (@user) in the message. For each mention, we log a :stroopwafel: gift in a database, from which we can build reports at the end of a period.\n\n\n\nThe original idea was tha whenever a message mentioned a :stroopwafel:, the bot would use pyodbc to save the message in a database. Databases are usually not free, but Azure offers SQL Server for as low as $5 per month, and that seemed acceptable. The problem is that pyodbc does not have a linux wheel, and currently Azure Functions for Linux requires wheels. There’s a way of compiling the package on the fly, but it currently has a bug. And I don’t know how long it will take to fix that bug.\nI searched for alternatives to PyODBC, and the best alternative was to use Cosmos DB, since its Python package pydocumentdb has a wheel. The downside is that the cheapest Cosmos DB plan as of this writing costs $25. And now we’re far away from objective #2, and we’re also not doing great with objective #4. However, I found Cosmos DB a pleasure to use.\n\n\n\nOnce I was done with my development, which Azure Functions Core Tools made really convenient by setting a local test server whenever I run func host start, I pushed my repository to GitHub and configured the Azure Function app to consume it using Continuous Deployment, which is something that you can set up in Azure with just a few clicks. However, it doesn’t yet work (sad trombone). Luckily, deploying without GitHub is not that bad. Again, Azure Functions Core Tools provides a command-line interface utility that pushes your application to the server: func azure functionapp publish &lt;app-name&gt;, and you’re done in a couple of minutes. But I also don’t fulfill objective #5.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough I was so far unable to fulfill half of my initial objectives, it looks like I’ll get there soon. There’s something magical about Azure Functions. It does a lot of the hard work for you, and if you’re familiar with one of the many languages available, you can deploy your program to production really fast. I had never developed a Slack bot before, and I’ve started the bot during a sleepless night and finished it in an afternoon. All in, it took me less than two days of work to get an app to production. There are still some kinks to be worked out but Azure Functions v2 has already proved to be useful to me."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, as part of a computer refresh, I have moved from a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 to a Lenovo P51.\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 3 was the right computer for me at the time I got it, but as time went by my position changed substantially, and it ceased to be appropriate for me.\nWhen I got the Surface, the core of my work consisted in traveling, having conference calls and light emailing and spreadsheet work. As time went by, my work went back to creating analytics, creating presentations about analytics, and traveling. There is where the screen of the Surface becomes a liability at 12 inches. I wanted something bigger.\nAnd boy, is the P51 bigger. It has a 15-inch screen and a power brick that alone is twice as heavy as the Surface Pro. It’s big enough to have a keyboard that comes with a numeric keypad. Since I still have to travel a lot, I chose the P51 over the beefier 17-inch P71. The P71 won’t even fit in my somewhat large Osprey backpack. The P51 barely fits.\nDue to some standardization constraints, my P51 is the 1920x1080 version with touch screen. It has 32 Gb of RAM and a 500 Gb SSD. It has the i7 7820HQ running at 2.9 GHz and a Quadro M2200 GPU. If I had the option, I’d choose the 4K screen and the Xeon processor, but I did not have that option.\nThe battery life is surprisingly good. For the kind of things that I do in planes (writing blog posts, editing presentations, light programming), the battery seems to last well over 8h without Wi-Fi and about 7h with Wi-Fi. I have yet to run out of battery in a flight. I have read that the earlier version of the P51, the P50, would trip the circuit breaker of a plane if you tried to plug it in. I have not attempted to plug in the P51 yet.\nThe P51 is usable in the Premium Economy seats and, of course, in business and first class seats, but I have the impression that it would not fit well in the economy class of carriers that have a very small distance between seats (like American Airlines domestic flights), especially if the person in front of you reclines their seat. It works well in exit seats.\nOne gripe I had about the Surface Pro 3 was that I always had to travel with a USB hub, a mouse, and a couple mini-DisplayPort adapters. The P51 comes with a mechanical keyboard, the beloved TrackPoint, a good TouchPad, 4 USB ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, an Ethernet port, an HDMI port, and, to my surprise, a mini-DisplayPort, so I get to keep all the adapters I had for the Surface.\nI’ve also considered the P51-S. The slimmer version trades off some power (it goes from quad-core to dual-core) for a thinner, lighter frame. I think the P51-S would also have been a solid choice, but I think it would force me to do most of my work from a workstation and/or a server that I’d need to remote into frequently, adding to the stress of versioning and synchronizing. Somewhat counter-intuitively, I chose the heavier computer because I travel a lot, as it has enough power for me to do the vast majority of my work on it and use a server or workstation just for the realhardcore stuff.\nIn summary, the Lenovo P51 is a great computer for the traveling data scientist. It’s powerful enough to be used as your primary machine. For me, it’s near the top limit of a computer that is comfortable to travel with, but still within that limit. I got used to it in no time and completely gave up my desktop workstation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Even though I work at Microsoft and really love Windows, I’ve recently installed Arch Linux as a dual boot.\nA lot of data scientists and software developers I know prefer OS X, and Windows doesn’t get that much love. Although many people provide many reasons not to use Windows, I was always able to work around whatever those issues were. Sometimes this required Cygwin, Git Bash, and more recently, WSL (the Windows Subsystem for Linux). I can’t remember any software that I was ever unable to use in Windows: LaTeX, git, Inkscape… everything I need had a decent Windows version, even if I had to compile it from source.\nWeirdly, because I can do so much with Windows, I find that I take too many shortcuts. The most damaging shortcuts are the ones that damage reproducibility, especially when creating documentation for my projects. It’s too easy to copy and paste into PowerPoint and be done with the communications for a talk. Some of my talks, especially about my most successful product, have many similar versions with one or two slides changed. Someone asks me for a slightly shorter or slightly longer talk and I suddenly have a new file with one or two extra (or hidden) slides that I may need to maintain. It’s not lost on me that this is a lack of discipline on my part, but if you were to invite me to a brigadeiro store, it would be hypocritical of you to accuse me of having no self-control.\n\n\nI first got into contact with Arch through a German friend back in 2010. When trying to install it, I quickly learned that Arch requires you to understand what you’re doing, and especially, that if you don’t understand what you’re doing, things break. Over time, I found that although some things have a steep learning curve, the return on the time investment was very positive. I also tried Ubuntu, Fedora and Red Hat, and although I could get productive more quickly, keeping them configured to my taste later was harder - when something broke it took me longer to understand what it was.\nThere are several things that still don’t work well in Linux. One of the most vexing is having a high-DPI display. It’s somewhat hard to configure it. It works well in KDE, but KDE has tearing issues. It doesn’t work too well in GNOME unless you use Wayland, which brings a host of different issues. You can make everything a lot worse by using the NVidia proprietary driver with Wayland, but it’s needed if you want to use the GPU efficiently.\nSo although I managed to configure my Arch installation to use GNOME under Wayland and use the NVidia proprietary driver, it’s very unstable. Native applications tend to run, but many applications crash in comical ways: resizing Google Chrome under Wayland is a sure way to cause a crash, for example."

    "title": "How to fail a technical phone screen",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I wrote earlier about the hiring process for technical positions at big technology companies. The three main steps are: 1) resume review, 2) technical phone screen, 3) on-site interview (part technical, part behavioral). This article is about the technical phone screen and how to (not) fail it.\nWhile usually disappointing, failing is not necessarily bad: it’s sometimes better to fail fast. You may get more time to focus on positions that you’re better suited for. I have myself failed several phone screens.\n\n\n\nImagine you come back hungry from a longer-than-expected trip, open the fridge and find an open bottle of milk. Do you sniff it first to make sure it’s not spoiled or drink it outright?\nSniffing tends to be the lower cost solution. It’s an imperfect solution, as maybe you’ll find tomorrow that the milk was spoiled but wasn’t stinky yet. However, if the milk is spoiled and already stinky, sniffing it is a lot less disgusting than taking a sip.\nThe phone screen is a sniff test. It is imperfect, it may be a bad experience, but it has a much lower cost than an interview. Although we occasionally use information from the phone screen in further steps of the hiring process, the main goal of a phone screen is to assess whether a candidate has a chance to pass the on-site interview.\nGiven the potential high costs of a false positive in a phone screen, interviewers that do phone screens tend to be more experienced than the average on-site interviewer. It’s also common for the hiring manager to be a phone screener. A phone screen can sometimes be the hardest interview in the whole process.\n\n\n\nThere’s only one clear and obvious case when the technical phone screen is not successful: a candidate passes the phone screen but fails hard at the interview. In that case, people in the interview panel may be annoyed at the phone screener.\nThere are several other outcomes that won’t be judged as harshly: the candidate fails the interview but just barely, the candidate fails the interview for that position but is a good fit for another, the candidate fails the interview for that position level but can be hired at a lower level. The phone screener won’t get called out on those.\nIt’s a lot harder to see failures when the candidate is rejected at the phone screen interview, as it’s harder to track what happened to the candidate. There are several cases of developers failing a phone screen in a company and being hired (and becoming very successful) in another, sometimes more prestigious, company.\nNote that the incentives are biased towards phone screeners rejecting more candidates than they should. This is a good reason to have phone screen interviewers be more experienced people (who may care less about other people being annoyed at them) or the hiring manager, who would take more risk to hire candidates.\nI have no scientific basis or good data for my next statement, but I think that regardless of the incentives above, phone screens still tend towards having more false negatives, that is, they reject people that would do well.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of phone screens is that they are remote. Therefore, it’s easier to cheat on them. The whole interviewing process is grueling, and the benefits of passing are pretty great, so I do understand why people want to cheat. I imagine it even works for some people. When it doesn’t work, however, it’s pretty bad.\n\nAs is widely known, lot of technical interview questions and their answers are available on LeetCode. Some interviewers use LeetCode questions, but adapt them for the phone screen interview, usually with good intentions: adding simplifying conditions to make the question easier and therefore making it possible to complete the question during a phone screen.\nWhen cheating candidates hear the question and search for it in LeetCode, they are usually elated to find the answer and gleefully type it pretending that they’re thinking about it on the spot. However, since the question was adapted, the LeetCode answer doesn’t work, it doesn’t even make any sense: it solves a different, more complex problem than the one being asked.\nAlthough the consequences may vary, they are at best the same as being eliminated by simply failing. If the candidate were to try to answer the question normally, they would probably do much better.\n\n\n\nIf the position requires SQL or some programming language, you are likely to be asked questions about SQL or that programming during the phone screen. I have seen candidates apply to positions that require SQL, write that they know SQL in their resume, get to the phone screen, and then say that they don’t know SQL when asked basic questions.\nThe rational explanation I can come up with is that these candidates are hoping for a false positive. As bad as the interview process is, it’s more likely to generate false negatives than false positives, and I think a candidate would have better chances playing the lottery.\n\n\n\nThe candidate is asked a question, but actually doesn’t know exactly how to solve it. Maybe they are nervous and forgot not only the syntax but even some concepts. Maybe they aren’t as experienced as their resume led the recruiters to believe.\nBy talking through their thinking, candidates can show that they know something, and would usually get some hints if they’re going in the right direction. However, at least once a quarter I have some candidate that becomes absolutely silent instead of talking through what they’re thinking and eventually gives up. This makes it hard to help these candidates.\n\n\n\n\nA while back, I ran an academic but unscientific experiment with some senior developer friends. We had 10 people participate. I chose a LeetCode problem and presented the solution to them. They were paired up such that half of them were interviewers, half of them were assigned to be candidates. The interviewers asked the same question that everybody had just seen to the “candidates”. The interviews were recorded and the “candidates” and interviewers were told that the recordings would be shown to students and some of their colleagues. This last part was a trigger: this was supposed to make the “candidates” nervous and self-conscious.\nThe question was a LeetCode “easy” question. The “candidates” were senior developers and they had seen the answer minutes before. Regardless, 3 of them (60%) couldn’t complete the question in 20 minutes with hints. The remaining 2 “candidates” needed hints to finish. All of them missed some key detail.\nRegardless, they would all pass a phone screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost candidates I see passing phone screens first restate the problem in their own words to make sure they understand it, clearly state any assumptions they are making, and then talk through their strategy to solve it. They check with the interviewer if their understanding, assumptions and strategy make sense. It is easier to fix problems in the beginning rather than after they start coding.\n\n\n\nWhile I understand a candidate will be very nervous during a phone screen and that is likely going to make it harder for them to organize their thinking, I think the strategies below will help them calm down and still be able to organize their thinking.\n\nThey comment their code: I wish I saw more comments in production. Of course, I wish I saw more comments in interviews. These comments may help you structure your thinking better and not forget things.\nThey use meaningful function and variable names: I wish I saw more meaningful names in production code. Of course, I wish I saw more meaningful names in interviews. This will help you remember what your code is supposed to do, and it will also help the interviewer understand what you’re trying to do and help you.\n\n\n\n\nI always try to tell my candidates that I don’t expect perfection, using different words. Although perfection may happen - I see it about once a year - most candidates will not get the answers completely correct. They will forget some condition, have some syntax problem, provide a solution that is not optimal. That’s usually ok.\nTrying to be perfect is likely to make candidates focus on the wrong things during the interview and get nervous if they can’t be perfect at that time, which will in turn prevent them from showing a lot of things that they’re perfectly good at.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you see people’s profiles on LinkedIn, you may think they have everything figured out and they just cruised to success, passing all phone screens and interviews and landing directly into their careers at prestigious companies.\nThat’s pretty far from the truth. Most people I know failed several interviews before getting where they are. The process is far from perfect and has a lot of false negatives.\nOf course a failure is a signal. You shouldn’t complete ignore it. You should try to learn from it. But be kind to yourself, too. Many people you admire failed quite a lot before eventually succeeding."

They will forget some condition, have some syntax problem, provide a solution that is not optimal. That’s usually ok.\nTrying to be perfect is likely to make candidates focus on the wrong things during the interview and get nervous if they can’t be perfect at that time, which will in turn prevent them from showing a lot of things that they’re perfectly good at."

    "text": "When you see people’s profiles on LinkedIn, you may think they have everything figured out and they just cruised to success, passing all phone screens and interviews and landing directly into their careers at prestigious companies.\nThat’s pretty far from the truth. Most people I know failed several interviews before getting where they are. The process is far from perfect and has a lot of false negatives.\nOf course a failure is a signal. You shouldn’t complete ignore it. You should try to learn from it. But be kind to yourself, too. Many people you admire failed quite a lot before eventually succeeding."

    "text": "This is what your calendar can look like.\n\n\n\nThis is not a recent and real calendar from me (so don’t try to book meetings in the open spaces) but it’s a really good approximation of a typical week.\nThese would be meetings with people, not blocked time to do work. This may not be representative of all managers, but once a manager has a team of size 10+, they may need lots of meetings to: - connect with members of their team for both ongoing work and career development - understand what clients want - synchronize with other internal teams we depend on - perform recruiting activities (interviewing, panels, presentations) - meetings with their own managers - meetings with peers to ensure we’re learning from each other\nI am an extreme introvert, and try really hard to avoid low-value meetings. But I still do 30+ hours. So if you want to be a manager, you need to like (or at least be able to endure) talking to people for a long time each week."

    "text": "Nobody in their right mind would ask me about how to become a singer or dancer.\nHowever, I have done many career discussions as a manager and as a mentor. The three career goals I’m asked about the most are: manager, Ph.D. and data scientist. This is, of course, a biased sample.\nThere are many books about becoming a technical manager. #ad The Manager’s Path and #ad The Making of a Manager are popular examples. They are both excellent books covering different aspects of managing. Read both if you can. Erika Pullum also has an excellent post about the importance of experience with a longer list of book recommendations.\nBecoming a people manager is a bigger career change than people realize, and should be done thoughtfully, as both the inputs and outputs of one’s work change substantially.\n\n\nOne of the common ways of becoming a manager is excelling as an individual contributor (IC). ICs are mostly measured against the direct impact of their work. When they do well, they are sometimes asked to try out management.\nManager performance is usually measured by a combination of team output and HR-related metrics for the team such as job satisfaction, manager satisfaction, retention, etc. It’s hard to achieve optimal output if the HR metrics are suffering.\nUnsurprisingly, the skills to perform well as an IC and the skills to perform well as a manager are different. Perversely, high-performance ICs that become manager have a handicap: they are usually a lot faster than their (new) direct reports. Instead of trying to develop and apply team management skills, these new managers sometimes take over work from their team members, preventing learning and growing, frustrating people and reducing the team’s effectiveness.\n\n\n\nA large part of a manager’s time is talking to people. Of course, it is extremely important to have frequent 1:1s with direct reports. Management books spend significant time on this topic (my favorite tip: keep 1:1 notes in a shared document accessible to both participants). In addition to 1:1s, managers also spend time talking to a whole lot of other people: their own managers, clients (internal and/or external), partner teams, suppliers, HR, Finance, recruiting. They also represent their team in planning meetings and review meetings. All those conversations add up, as it can be seen in a sample manager calendar below, in which all purple meetings are conversations with other people.\n\nWith that much pressure on their calendars, it’s no surprise that managers give a lot of value to meeting efficiency. One of my favorite books on the topic is The Surprising Science of Meetings. Managers also need to be very efficient with their own time, which brings us to our next topic.\n\n\n\nAs hard as it is to coordinate a large team, having a shorthanded team is a lot worse. There are many reasons for a team to be shorthanded: people can leave for several reasons (competing offers, going back to school, etc.) or the team’s mission and scope may grow.\nIn any case, the sooner a manager can fill an opening with quality, the least they have to endure disruption to their time and to their team. Experienced managers develop large and deep networks, both internally and externally.\nThe external network allows managers to recruit external candidates more quickly and to keep a pulse in the job market. The internal network is important for several reasons: the first and more obvious is to find internal candidates, which tend to require less ramp-up.\nA second reason is that a lot of a team’s work depends on other teams. One way to develop these internal networks is to help fellow managers hire: experienced interviewers are always in demand. A final, but important reason: managers occasionally find themselves on the other side of the interview table, and having a good networks helps finding good seats.\n\n\n\nDuring all those meetings, lots of commitments are generated. As a manager, your team will make commitments, and other teams will make commitments to your team. A lot of a manager’s time is prioritizing and keeping track of all these commitments, and a perhaps surprising portion of the time is spent renegotiating them.\nGiven the importance of tracking commitments, a large part of the management literature and tooling is dedicated to that topic. Different teams will have access to different tools and methodologies. Like the old adage “failing to plan is planning to fail”, having a process and tool is usually far better than having none.\nA consistent process will outlive tools. I have been using the #ad Getting Things Done process for many years, but I have implemented it over several different tools during that period: Jira, Azure DevOps, Microsoft Tasks, OneNote, Quip, Wunderlist and many others.\n\n\n\nWith all the time spent in meetings, recruiting and commitment tracking, there will be a lot less time left to learn new technologies. The longer someone spends in management, the more they have to move to the nitty-gritty details of existing and new technologies to the 30,000-foot strategic view of a technology’s application.\nThis is perhaps the most important trade-off of choosing a tech management career. Experience with managerial tasks, or “seat time” matters a lot for success as a manager, but once one moves to a management position, lot of time that could be spent learning technologies and techniques will be consumed by meetings, recruiting and commitment tracking.\nMove into management too early and one’s experience may have to rely more on “seat time” instead of “tech depth”. Take too long to move and one may have enough “tech depth” to be frustrated at their team members lack of expertise, and may not have the “seat time” required to be an efficient manager for them.\n\n\nI found that I derive a lot more pleasure at telling somebody that they got the job that they applied for than from getting a new job myself. A similar thing happened when telling somebody that they got a promotion. And when somebody’s article got accepted to a conference. And in many other similar things.\nI found that I enjoyed helping others succeed through early experiences with mentorship, before I became a manager. Being a manager is living vicariously and enjoying it. It’s not that I don’t enjoy being personally successful, but being a part of great teams and helping them succeed brought me more happiness than I think I could have found on my own.\nWhen you feel the same, it’s worth it trying it out."

For example, most of the rote phrases that people say in daily interactions such as “how’s your weekend going?” were literally foreign to me. It took me a while to realize that nobody really wanted to know about my weekend.\nQuite a bit of academics later, I started writing, mostly for myself. I found, to nobody’s surprise, that writing makes one’s thoughts clearer. About a year ago, I joined #Amazon. At Amazon, we literally write for a living. A number of work processes require writing documents. I also started to write to a broader audience here on LinkedIn, and I get the occasional (and very much appreciated) note from people that tell me that they like my writing and that it helped them.\nI still don’t meet my own ever-rising bar, and I still throw away a lot of what I write.

    "text": "There are a lot of tech companies in Seattle, and if you know something about Seattle, it’s probably that it rains a lot. Here’s how I deal with the big dark.\nFor all its fame, #Seattle gets 37 inches of rain per year. Sunny Miami gets 62 inches. Of course, measuring things is tricky, and an art that we #DataScientists are (or at least should be) very familiar with. Measuring things differently, Seattle has around 150 “sunny days” per year, and Miami has around 250. That’s almost three months less.\nMeasuring things in yet another way, the average number of hours of sunlight in Seattle per year is approximately 2,000. Miami and LA get approximately 3,200. Las Vegas gets 3,800. Besides being cloudy and rainy, Seattle is further to the north, and the sun sets before 5 PM for a large part of the winter.\nI find that the lack of sunlight gets to me a lot more than the rain and the temperature, both of which I actually enjoy.\nOne trick I learned is to use “corn cob lightbulbs” everywhere in my house. A 50W corn cob bulb produces 5,000 lumens. A typical 13W CFL light produces about 1,000 lumens, the same as a 60W incandescent light. After installing corn cob lightbulbs in my office, I started feeling a lot less tired after a long day of #wfh during the winter, even finding energy to cook and play board games with my kids.\nIf you’re considering to move to Seattle, it’s not about the umbrellas. It rarely rains hard enough to justify using one. It’s more about finding a way of being outside when there’s sunlight (and there are plenty of great things to do around Seattle what that’s the case) and getting enough illumination when one can’t go out."

    "text": "Should you choose #Microsoft or #FAANG?\nLast week, a Microsoft #recruiter I admire and has a lot of followers posted something about Microsoft being the gateway to FAANG. Having been into both Microsoft and FAANG and having participated on hundreds of recruiting processes for both (as an interviewer, hiring manager and interviewee), I have #feelings about this. Lots of feelings.\nFirst off, let’s get my economist way of thinking and potential biases out of the way. By revealed preference, you know I prefer Microsoft to FAANG, at least under the conditions that were offered to me. I recently chose to come back to work for Microsoft from FAANG (I also had recent offers from other FAANGs). Therefore, take my words with a grain of salt.\nAlso, given recent performance, FAANGs are not an investment thing anymore. For pop-investing fans, the acronym is now MAMAA, one of which is Microsoft (Netflix was dropped).\nBut this doesn’t matter, since the main argument about FAANGs was about recruiting: FAANGs (allegedly) pay better than Microsoft. There are non-FAANG companies that also (at least used to) pay extremely well (e.g., Airbnb and Uber). When recruiters compete against FAANGs, it’s a difficult fight. It’s not uncommon to have a FAANG offer that is 50% over other companies. You don’t have to spend a lot of time in Blind to find out that in terms of total compensation, FAANGs pay very well.\nI can tell you: it’s great to be paid very well. I can also tell you: it’s not the only thing that matters.\nAs a data scientist, I think a lot about optimization problems. If your personal career optimization problem is solving for maximizing short-term total compensation (TC), FAANGs are great. And, as that same recruiter wrote in a subsequent post, there’s no shame on having that goal.\nBut maybe you want to optimize for other things: work/life balance, impact, stress, learning, risk, work environment. Short-term TC is super important, especially in when you want to get a house, buy a car, get established, pay those student loans. But after some point, it may matter less to you. Privilege check: this is about choosing between high degrees of privilege, and I’m blessed and humbled to have the opportunity to choose, as many in the tech area do.\nFor the opportunities that were available to me, Microsoft was by far the best option for what I was optimizing for: learning, working with people I admire, work life balance, being able to talk about my work, having lasting impact on the world, and very good compensation with lower stock market risk.\nAs any person that knows about Goodhart’s Law or Charlie Munger can tell you, you get what you optimize for. When you’re choosing what you are optimizing for, make sure that it is what you really want."

    "text": "One of the worst things I have done as a manager was to go to a meeting. Luckily, I had a friend on that meeting (also a manager) that taught me something really important.\nHere’s what I did wrong.\nThere was this meeting between several data science teams. It was really hard to find a time that worked for everybody. The meeting ended up being scheduled on a Friday morning, at about 9 AM on the day I was going on vacations. I couldn’t go, so I gave the meeting to one of my directs and we planned it out together. Some of the other teams had prep meetings, of which both me and my direct could (and did) participate. I couldn’t be on the big meeting to align on the roadmap, but it was well-supported and felt like everything was under control. Other members of my team would also attend to provide details about their projects, and they were well-prepared.\nOn the day of the meeting, which was also the first day of my long-awaited vacations, I was packed and ready to leave for my trip when I got a notice that my flight was delayed. I was planning to leave home a little after 9 AM, but now I could safely leave 10:30 AM and still arrive comfortably at the airport. Staying home longer would even mean less traffic to the airport.\nWith time to spare, I decided to join the meeting, even though I was a little late. When I joined, the meeting stopped, and people said something to the effect of “Oh, Lucas, I thought you were on vacation and were not going to join”, to which I responded: “I’m on vacations, but my flight was delayed. Since I could join and didn’t want to miss the meeting, I joined”.\nSurprisingly directly and publicly, my friend on the meeting said: “Nah, you should log off. Otherwise, you’re going to start giving my team and your team the impression that they should join meetings during their vacations if they can, and that’s not setting a good example for work life balance”. (This was at Amazon, by the way).\nI flushed for 10 seconds (it was an audio call only, thankfully) but realized she was completely right. I was a little embarrassed for being called out in public, but I’m usually not embarrassed for being wrong, at least not for long. I said: “You’re right, sorry for the disruption, I’m the least prepared for this meeting since I wasn’t planning to attend, and I’m sure I’ll be updated when I get back, I’ll drop off now”, got a bunch of “Have a good vacation” and disconnected.\nIn addition to showing that “vacations are important”, I also had the opportunity to show that “being wrong is ok”. Nobody was shutting me out. When I came back, I took over that workstream and ran it to the end. I was just making it harder for my team to help me by showing that I could help myself. Besides, we were just being fiercely protective of the work/life balance that we worked so hard to achieve on that group.\nI didn’t realize the message I was sending, and I was glad to be called out."

To my knowledge, there are three ways to do it:\n\nYou can write an article\nYou can create a training\nYou can post an external link\n\nThe problem of writing an article on LinkedIn is that the editor is good for text pieces but unfriendly for technical content, especially for code and source control. In addition, the editor requires the writer to edit online all the time. In practice, I mostly copied and pasted.\nThe problem of creating a training is that I think it’s a lot of work. I never tried, and maybe it’s easier than I think it is, but just getting started seems like a lot.\nInstead of using LinkedIn, a very popular option is to use Medium or, more specifically, “Towards Data Science” (TDS), a subset of Medium articles focused on data science. I frequently find articles I like in TDS, but it’s somewhat pay-walled. You get just a few free articles for free. For authors, the advantages are that TDS is widely promoted in search results and that authors get paid. Not enough to quit a job and write for TDS, but enough to buy a couple books per year. Other options are newsletters, but it starts to feel too much like a job.\nThe LinkedIn algorithm seems to punish posts that only point users to an external article. I can understand that: this type of post is unlikely to generate any engagement inside of LinkedIn: people just “click out”.\nIn any case, the problem I wanted to solve was to be able to write more technical posts from time to time, but still be able to post those to LinkedIn automatically. To write technical posts on my blog, I started using #Quarto and loving it. Recently, I wrote some code to configure Quarto to post automatically to LinkedIn. The code scans my Quarto files and uses the LinkedIn API to post them. If they fit fully as text, it posts them as a normal post. If they’re too large, it posts the beginning of the article and a link to my blog.\nNow, when I write a blog post (technical or non-technical) or even real work code, I can choose to automatically post it to LinkedIn and Twitter by simply adding some front-matter to my file.\nThis solves many problems for me. With that, I now do all my writing in VS Code. I don’t need to use Buffer anymore. I even have version control.\nNow I just need to write interesting stuff!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "One thing I find in my interviews is that data scientists are a lot better at calculating expectations than they are at defining loss functions.\nUsing some recent (July 2022) events, I wrote a question that requires setting up and optimizing a loss function.\n“Musky promised to pay his friend Tweety US$ 1,000. Musky refused to pay, and now Tweety is suing Musky. Musky can either pay $1000 (Tweety won’t settle) or go to court. If Musky goes to court, he needs to pay lawyers. Good lawyers are costly, and don’t guarantee that Musky will win. The probability of Musky prevailing is a function of cost of his lawyers: ln(C)/7, where C is the amount Musky pays, and ln is the natural log function. Should Musky pay or go to court? If he goes to court, how much should Musky pay his lawyers? Assume Musky only cares about money.”\nThe first step is to set up the loss function in case Musky goes to trial. Going to trial requires paying C to the lawyers, and that gives Musky a probability to win of ln(C)/7, which means that his probability of losing is 1-ln(C)/7.\n\\[\nL = -C - (1- \\frac{ln(C)}{7}) \\times 1000\n\\]\nSince he only cares about money, Musky objective is to minimize his loss. To find the minimum of the loss function, we need to take the first derivative of this function and making it equal to zero. Luckily, natural logs have a simple derivative (1/x) and that’s not too hard to do. Regardless, I’d let candidates use Wolfram Alpha to take derivatives, or whatever calculator they want to.\nSince the derivative ends up being 1000/7C - 1, the next steps are simple, and the result is 1000/7, meaning that to minimize his losses, Musky should pay $143.86 to his lawyers.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta L}{\\delta C} = \\frac{1000}{7C} - 1\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{1000}{7C} - 1 = 0 \\implies C = \\frac{1000}{7} = 142.86\n\\]\nThis results in an expected loss of $434.02 (of which $142.86 goes to the lawyers). It’s bad, but it’s a lot better than losing $1000.\nIf you like data science interview questions, my friend Nirmal Budhathoki has been posting 30 days of them on LinkedIn. His questions are great (certainly better than mine above), and you should follow his series."

    "section": "",
    "text": "You may have been taught to avoid emails that are full of errors and absurd claims (such a prince wanting your help). You may think that the fraudsters that use such emails are lazy or uneducated, and that the emails have errors because the fraudsters are not good at English. The truth is a lot more fun.\nWe start by assuming that the “fraudster”/“bad actor” is a profit maximizer, and that their cost per hour is $10. Let’s assume it costs $50 to create an email with errors, and $200 to craft an error-free email. They pay this cost only once.\nLet’s also assume that they can send that email for free to 1 million people, of which 10% (100,000) are “gullible” (easy to trick), and the remaining 900,000 are “skeptical” (hard to trick). When a potential victim responds, the bad actor has to invest some time with them to get their financial information. If they’re gullible, the bad actor has to invest 5 hours ($50) on average, and they get $1,000. If they’re skeptical, the bad actor will invest 10 hours on average to realize that they’re skeptical, and will get no financial information (profit = $0).\nThe email with errors gets a 2 out of 10 response from gullible people and no response from skeptical people. If the bad actor uses this email, the victim pool will have 20,000 gullible people. The well-crafted email gets a 8 out of 10 response from gullible people and a 1 out of 9 response from skeptical people. In this case, the victim pool will have 80,000 gullible and 90,000 skeptical people.\nAfter sending the e-mail, the bad actor has a 1,000-hour budget (that’s about 6 months of work) to work with the pool of respondents. When they choose a new potential victim from the pool of respondents, assume the draw is uniformly distributed over the proportions of the pool. That is, for the error-free email, they get a gullible person with probability 8/17 and a skeptical with probability 9/17. For the email with errors, it’s always a gullible person.\nWhich of the two emails should the bad actor send in order to maximize their profits?\nFollow-up: should the bad actor invest in an even better email that everyone (gullible and skeptical) responds to?\nIf you work through the example, you’ll find that the email with errors performs better, because it filters out time-wasting smart people. Real scammers use bad emails on purpose: only the very gullible will respond, making the scammer job easier."

    "text": "If you have been following the news for the last few years, you have seen how much the prevalence of misinformation, disinformation (intentional misinformation), and propaganda (intentional misinformation by state actors) has increased a lot. Most topics of interest online have a shocking proportion of misinformation: Ukraine, COVID, elections, etc.\nDetermining whether a news article is fake or not is a difficult problem for both people and computer models. This ACM survey paper (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3395046) gives a good idea about the state of the art around 2020. It is far from a solved problem.\nAs you would expect, computer scientists break difficult problems into parts, and even the subtasks for fake news detection are hard. A few examples of subtasks are detecting if the headline matches the content of the news, evaluating the reputation of who is sharing the news, evaluating the reputation of the news website, etc.\nFor this latter task, a product I have found to be useful is NewsGuard https://www.newsguardtech.com/. Although NewsGuard has been (in my opinion, fairly) criticized a few years ago for having a bias towards the left, it has been improving continuously. These days, I find it very helpful, especially since I study disinformation and fraud for a living, and therefore my browsing patterns are… atypical.\nIt helps that NewsGuard is free for users of Microsoft Edge. You can install a NewsGuard extension and it will show whether the site you are seeing is trustworthy. It will also integrate with Bing when used in Edge, and show a badge next to each result.\nIf you want to try it out, the following link has the instructions: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/newsguard-b28e453e-568c-4d57-98ef-c61056f99462. Note that it’s only free for Microsoft Edge, which is a great browser that runs in a number of platforms such as Linux, Mac, etc."

I’m going to assume that it’s a crash test dummy, not an allusion to the recent acquisition of #Twitter. The problem I have is with the gears.\nYou see, if the person with the mustache and the red shirt turns the gear clockwise, this would push the other two gears to turn counter-clockwise. But these other two gears push each other in opposite directions.\nFor example, if “red” moves clockwise, it will push “green” to move counter-clockwise, which in turn pushes “blue” to move clockwise, which in turn pushes “red” to move counter-clockwise… but “red” was being pushed to move clockwise to begin with. This whole gear system is stuck: if someone tries to introduce any movement, the system works to stay firmly locked into place.\nI’m still trying to decide if this is a mistake. Maybe it’s just great art, a subtle criticism about #teamwork that the artist snuck in. Maybe they worked in a #toxic workplace, or had a lot of group projects in high school.\nIt’s in days like this that I realize how luck I’ve been in my career.

    "text": "Happy Towel Day for those who celebrate it! On this day, fans of the famous Douglas Adams’ book Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy carry a towel with them everywhere. Why? Because, as the Guide says, a towel is the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. As a tribute to the book, I decided to write a blog post about the number 42, which is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\n\n\nIn the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, a supercomputer named Deep Thought is asked to calculate the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything. After seven and a half million years, Deep Thought returns with the answer: forty-two. Although there are many theories about why the number came to be (101010 in binary, the angle at which light refracts through water to create a rainbow, etc.), the truth is that Douglas Adams chose the number randomly.\nIn his words: “The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought ‘42 will do’ I typed it out. End of story.”\n\n\n\nPerhaps, subconsciously, Adams chose the number forty-two because of its significance in the works of another author that is also known for his use of humor and wit, and also admired by scientists, especially mathematicians. Lewis Carroll, the writer of Alice in Wonderland, made repeated use of the number 42 in his writings. The original version of Alice in Wonderland had 42 illustrations, and the king also makes use of rule 42, stating that all persons more than a mile high must leave the court immediately. His poem, the Hunting of the Snark, also has a rule 42 (no one shall speak to the man at the helm).\nThe number 42 also appeared in Doctor Who, Star Trek, and The X-Files. Once the number made its way into literature and other media liked by scientists, it would not take long until it was used in computer science.\n\n\n\nGenerating random numbers is a common task in computer science. One way to generate random numbers is to use a seed, which is a number that is used to initialize a pseudorandom number generator. The same seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers. Using a seed allows for reproducibility, which is important for debugging and testing.\nIn 2016, the software engineer Aleksey Bilogur published a blog post analyzing GitHub and searching for the most used random seeds. The results: 0 was the most used seed, with 40% of the results, with 42 coming in second with 17.3% of the results, followed by 1 with 16.8%, 1234 with 4.14%, and 123 with 1.75%.\n\n\n\nIn the book, the Guide is a competitor to the Encyclopedia Galactica, which is a repository of all knowledge in the universe. The Guide, instead of being written by experts, can comically be edited by anyone. The big advantage of the Guide, which accounts for most of its success, is that it’s slightly cheaper. Presciently, that is similar to the way Wikipedia works.\nTherefore, on this Towel Day, I am donating $42 to Wikipedia, which my employer generously matches.\nHappy Towel Day!"
