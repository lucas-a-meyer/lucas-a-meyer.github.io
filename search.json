You have the mechanisms to run proper A/B tests: you can bucket users into A and B groups such that the only difference between them is the color palette. You choose, arbitrarily, a random palette, run the experiment for a week, and find that the users in the B group have a $200k lift in revenue, which annualized represents a $10M increase in revenue. That’s not nothing. You roll it out to all users, write your performance review, book a party and wait for your promotion.\nThere’s just one important thing missing: you have no idea exactly why it worked. Here’s a few possible explanations, some of which are quite far-fetched:\n\nMaybe the new palette just randomly made your site look more like its main competitor, and users that would normally leave your site keep using it, blissfully unaware. The next time your competitor changes their color schema, these users will not be confused anymore and will leave. And maybe they’ll do this next week, because they just realized they lost some users.\nMaybe the color palette of the world outside makes your new palette very attractive, but only for the season when the test ran, but it makes it less attractive in other seasons of the year. With the change you’re actually losing money for the year. That’s a little bit of a joke explanation, but it has a strong scientific basis (the “crocs and socks illusion”, also the “dress illusion”).\nMaybe you found a cheat code, the exact combination of colors that makes other people understand you better, and could use this to improve educational outcomes and save the whole world $1T per year, rather than $200k for that week. By deploying it to your site and moving on, you have a lost opportunity cost of approximately $1T.\nMaybe you really found something that only makes it easier for users to use your site and that it’s going to work well for one year or more, so it’s really valued at $10M per year… as long as you don’t make any other changes to the site.\n\nYour A/B experiment is on the top of the evidence pyramid, but for which of the cases above? Without a theory and alternative explanations, you may never know.\nThere is, however, a hint that you learned something, and that it’s familiar to data scientists: the descriptive, predictive and prescriptive/causal framework. When you really understand how something works, if you have the resources, you can make it happen at will. For example, if the reason why you got a lift in your experiment is because you were looking like your much larger competitor, you could now mimic their color palette every time they make a change and keep getting the lift. You could mimic palettes of other larger competitors and get lifts there, too.\nA/B tests are great evidence when you understand the question. Better make sure you do."

After seven and a half million years, Deep Thought returns with the answer: forty-two. Although there are many theories about why the number came to be (101010 in binary, the angle at which light refracts through water to create a rainbow, etc.), the truth is that Douglas Adams chose the number randomly.\nIn his words: “The answer to this is very simple. It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base thirteen, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat at my desk, stared into the garden and thought ‘42 will do’ I typed it out. End of story.”"

Lewis Carroll, the writer of Alice in Wonderland, made repeated use of the number 42 in his writings. The original version of Alice in Wonderland had 42 illustrations, and the king also makes use of rule 42, stating that all persons more than a mile high must leave the court immediately. His poem, the Hunting of the Snark, also has a rule 42 (no one shall speak to the man at the helm).\nThe number 42 also appeared in Doctor Who, Star Trek, and The X-Files. Once the number made its way into literature and other media liked by scientists, it would not take long until it was used in computer science."

Using a seed allows for reproducibility, which is important for debugging and testing.\nIn 2016, the software engineer Aleksey Bilogur published a blog post analyzing GitHub and searching for the most used random seeds. The results: 0 was the most used seed, with 40% of the results, with 42 coming in second with 17.3% of the results, followed by 1 with 16.8%, 1234 with 4.14%, and 123 with 1.75%."

However, I recently stumbled upon an unexpected weakness of Copilot - it’s not very good at very new APIs.\nThe other day, I was using the new ChatCompletion API from GPT, and my Copilot didn’t know about it. It kept pushing me to the older Completion API. It made me realize that these AI-powered tools are still learning and growing. It will be interesting to see how these tools will balance new and established APIs in the future.\nInstead of being frustrated, I think it’s a good thing that Copilot is not perfect. It’s a good reminder that we are still in the early days of AI, and there is still a lot of room for improvement in AI-powered tools.\nMoreover, this makes me less worried about AI taking over the world. If AI decides to attack, it may use swords and shields, not the latest weapons, because it has a lot more battles with swords and shields in its training set. In conclusion, while we should still be cautious about the power and influence of AI, we should also embrace its imperfections and use it as a tool to make our lives easier."

    "text": "I have “quietly left” Twitter. I’ve configured my devices in a way that I can only see Twitter if I use a specific device, and that usually takes more effort that it’s worth. That’s also how I tamed several other digital habits.\n\nA few years ago, I used the same method to quit Facebook and its properties. It is really hard to leave these platforms completely, so I’m not deleting my account. You may even be reading this on Twitter, because I’m also not changing the tool I use to cross-post between Twitter and LinkedIn.\nMy Twitter ride was great. For a long time it really sucked, but then I realized how to mute words and people and things got a lot better. After purging the bad content from my timeline, I found a really cool niche of data science on Twitter, and met wonderful people who helped me a lot in my career so far: Tanya Cashorali, James David Long, Jesse Mostipak, Gabriela de Queiroz, Casey Almond and Vicki Boykis.\nVicki has several posts that changed how I think about the world. The reason why I left facebook was because of Vicki’s post about the data facebook collects. I learned to be grateful about the privilege that entitled me to leave facebook due to her post about digital noise. If you’re reading this on LinkedIn, the links to her posts will not appear, you need to see this post in my blog.\nRight now, I’m trying Mastodon and it’s going super well. It took about a day for things to really catch up, but it did. Most of the people I followed on Twitter and LinkedIn already showed up. It’s glorious. If you are in Mastodon, come say hi.\nEven though Twitter is a dumpster fire right now, I think it will survive. I think the specialized niches that thrived on Twitter will leave to Mastodon, where there will be less noise. I think the “pop culture” aspect of Twitter will remain. The way I’m thinking of this is: I don’t expect a Kardashian to show up on Mastodon, and I don’t expect scientists to move back to Twitter. It’s probably for the best."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This post is revisiting an earlier post from May about salaries in tech companies, especially after the recent layoffs.\nWhen I wrote that post, I had just left Amazon to come to Microsoft. I was discussing the argument that FAANGs and many other tech companies such as AirBnB, Uber, and #Twitter paid a lot better than Microsoft. The market was starting to cool down after being super hot for a couple of years. Other data scientists I knew were still getting very generous offers from tech companies. Back then, Microsoft was seen as having a compensation problem, such that just a week later, on May 16th 2022, Microsoft announced that it was increasing its compensation to retain employees.\nThe conversations around that time were usually like this: someone would tell me that they got an offer from a tech company for 50% more their current total compensation. Then they would boldly ask me if my recent Microsoft package was as big as theirs, and if I thought they should take the offer.\nMy answer is super boring: “compensation is important but it’s not the only thing, maybe you want to optimize for other things like job security, a mission that you believe in, work-life balance, etc.”\nAt around the time, I also started suggesting that people look at how much of their pay would be coming from stocks. It was a lot, in some cases as much as 80%. I would ask them if they were comfortable with taking all that risk. Most people were.\nFor my own example, when I left Amazon, about 40% of my compensation was salary and 60% stock. Before leaving, I sold my vested Amazon stock at a (split-adjusted) price of $177. Today’s (November 4th 2022) market price is $89, almost exactly half. That would have been a 30% pay cut for me. Of course this works both ways - had the price doubled instead of halved, I would have gotten a 60% increase on my total compensation.\nThe above is only considering compensation risk, but you can take even more risk. I know plenty of people that never sell their RSUs. Besides taking risk with their compensation, they are also taking risks with their wealth. When their company is doing well, stocks go up and both their compensation and wealth go up. But when the company is not doing well, they may lose their job at the exact time their wealth is taking a big hit.\nAs I got older, I got more risk averse. For the last 10+ years, I have religiously diversified from my RSUs using a 10b5-1 plan, which I implemented manually. These plans are becoming more mainstream: there’s a company called Candor that automates the RSU diversification process. Although I have myself never used their services, I am a regular reader of Niya Dragova’s newsletter and I have also talked to David Chouinard abut RSUs. It’s definitely worth checking them out."

    "text": "While not a representative sample, most data scientists I know use MacOS. I have used MacOS at Amazon, but for most of my career, I have used Linux. Arch Linux. Yes… I use Arch, btw.\nArch has a fame of being difficult to install. That is not necessarily fair, since all one needs to do is to follow the installation instructions on the wonderful ArchWiki. The difficulty is that Arch would not make any choices for you: to install it, you needed to understand and choose things that most people just “take the default”. For example, network driver, disk filesystem, even your text editor. Yes, Arch won’t even install vi for you. Or a WiFi driver. The user needs to read and understand the Wiki really well, or things won’t work.\nFurthermore, once done with the installation instructions, a user has only a command-line interface system. If the user wants a graphical desktop environment they have to install it, which means making another choice, which means having to learn about all the options and think about them, which means more reading and time commitment.\n\nArch is like that for everything. The result is a system that only has software that the user needs and understands. Other Linux distributions like Ubuntu get users up and running with just a few clicks. Most decisions are made on behalf of the users. The default installation comes with a lot of stuff that is not needed nor understood. The user doesn’t need to care about all their options, so they don’t. Arch is better if you’re optimizing for those dimensions, but in many (most?) cases, it’s better to optimize for time and get something more user-friendly. I use Arch, btw.\n“I use Arch btw” is about users becoming so proud of being able to install their Arch systems that they can’t help telling everyone, finding ways to drop the hint even when it’s not a good time.\n\n\n\nThe major constraint of using Arch is that it has all the setbacks of a Linux desktop. It’s not great for gaming, although it’s getting much better. It misses some useful work software such as Microsoft Office. The alternatives (e.g., LibreOffice) are not that great for my use cases. For my work, I also need Visual Studio 2022, which is also not available. The solution was to install a Windows VM, but to use your computer for games, one would need to either dual-boot or have a different machine.\nRecently, I am trying a new approach: the Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2). Arch is not one of the default options, but it can be done. The advantage of using WSL2 instead of a VM is that WSL2 has a great user experience. It feels like having a Linux command-line system with a desktop environment (Windows) that can run commercial software. I think that this is what people like about MacOS.\nFor example, When I run my VS Code editor from the Arch CLI, it opens VS Code in #Windows 11. It saves the files to #Arch. I can render with #Quarto on Arch and upload the blog to #Github Pages using the shell commands I’m used to.\nThe only difference is that instead of having a VSCode window in KDE, it’s in Windows 11. I can do that while waiting for my jobs to run in Visual Studio and replying to my email in Outlook 365. I can create Power BIs from the CSVs that are on my Arch file system, because the WSL filesystem integrates well with Windows. It’s pretty great.\n\nI can even run XServer software on Windows. The most impressive thing is that I can still use CUDA in Arch and run models that take advantage of my laptop’s GPU, because the Windows Nvidia driver supports my Arch-based WSL2 installation.\n\n\n\nIs this really using Arch? Probably not. My audio works, my network configuration worked out of the box, I can even print. Someone who starts using Arch in WSL doesn’t have to go through the trouble of understanding and overcoming these issues. Maybe it’s an Arch-lite experience… like Manjaro?\n\nI think people worry too much about gatekeeping. You should use whatever makes you productive. I use Arch, btw."

    "text": "Ed Rice, one of my former Finance professors, was once telling me how teaching Economics is different from teaching Physics.\nNot exactly about how the science differs, but about how people react when being taught.\nFor example, a Physics professor walks into a lecture hall, puts some formulas on the whiteboard and states: “let’s assume we’re in a vacuum and all surfaces are frictionless”. Students obediently copy the formulas and start working with them, learning about the interactions between their terms. They soon start imagining their applicability in the real world, where these conditions don’t hold.\nAn Economics professor walks into a lecture hall, puts some formulas on the whiteboard and states: “let’s assume consumers have rational preferences, which are defined as…”. Ten students storm out of the lecture hall. Two students start crying. A more outspoken student yells from the back: “Surely people aren’t rational!”\nThe professor tries to explain: “you know, rational preferences mean…” Another student chimes in: “Rational? Are you even watching the news? Half the people in this country aren’t rational”. All students agree, not immediately realizing that they would disagree about which half.\nA student wearing a designer Burberry t-shirt steps up: “Why are you implying that we’re all consumers? That’s predatory capitalism. Consumers is a no-no word, and from now on, please just refer to it as the c-word!”, while recording the interaction in their Swarovski encrusted iPhone for their TikTok followers.\nAt this very moment, the Physics professor steps into the Economics lecture hall: “Hey, you are being too noisy and disturbing my class. We’re doing science next door, can you please be quieter?” This helps. People start to calm down.\nThe Economics professor takes a deep breath. “As I was trying to explain, in Economics, rational preferences mean…”, but Burberry interrupts again, to the general agreement of other students: “We know what rational means - it means somebody who uses dispassionate logic and reason to make decisions. I did a survey among my Twitter followers and over 90% of them agree that people are not rational. Hashtag EconomistsSuck”. (Note: I don’t know if TikTok has hashtags).\nDisheartened, the Economics professor tries their final weapon. “Ok, I know you’pre not cons… I mean, c-words, you are people. Do you people want to learn how to make a lot of money in the stock market so that you can buy whatever you want?” Everybody gets real quiet.\nSpoiler alert: he’s going to tell them to invest in an index fund.

    "section": "",
    "text": "One thing I find in my interviews is that data scientists are a lot better at calculating expectations than they are at defining loss functions.\nUsing some recent (July 2022) events, I wrote a question that requires setting up and optimizing a loss function.\n“Musky promised to pay his friend Tweety US$ 1,000. Musky refused to pay, and now Tweety is suing Musky. Musky can either pay $1000 (Tweety won’t settle) or go to court. If Musky goes to court, he needs to pay lawyers. Good lawyers are costly, and don’t guarantee that Musky will win. The probability of Musky prevailing is a function of cost of his lawyers: ln(C)/7, where C is the amount Musky pays, and ln is the natural log function. Should Musky pay or go to court? If he goes to court, how much should Musky pay his lawyers? Assume Musky only cares about money.”\nThe first step is to set up the loss function in case Musky goes to trial. Going to trial requires paying C to the lawyers, and that gives Musky a probability to win of ln(C)/7, which means that his probability of losing is 1-ln(C)/7.\n\\[\nL = -C - (1- \\frac{ln(C)}{7}) \\times 1000\n\\]\nSince he only cares about money, Musky objective is to minimize his loss. To find the minimum of the loss function, we need to take the first derivative of this function and making it equal to zero. Luckily, natural logs have a simple derivative (1/x) and that’s not too hard to do. Regardless, I’d let candidates use Wolfram Alpha to take derivatives, or whatever calculator they want to.\nSince the derivative ends up being 1000/7C - 1, the next steps are simple, and the result is 1000/7, meaning that to minimize his losses, Musky should pay $143.86 to his lawyers.\n\\[\n\\frac{\\delta L}{\\delta C} = \\frac{1000}{7C} - 1\n\\] \\[\n\\frac{1000}{7C} - 1 = 0 \\implies C = \\frac{1000}{7} = 142.86\n\\]\nThis results in an expected loss of $434.02 (of which $142.86 goes to the lawyers). It’s bad, but it’s a lot better than losing $1000.\nIf you like data science interview questions, my friend Nirmal Budhathoki has been posting 30 days of them on LinkedIn. His questions are great (certainly better than mine above), and you should follow his series."

That’s a lot to keep track of. Sometimes, I wanted to find something that I wrote and it would take me a while.\nNow, I use Quarto for everything.\nMy biggest audience is on LinkedIn, but it’s not that easy to post technical content. To my knowledge, there are three ways to do it:\n\nYou can write an article\nYou can create a training\nYou can post an external link\n\nThe problem of writing an article on LinkedIn is that the editor is good for text pieces but unfriendly for technical content, especially for code and source control. In addition, the editor requires the writer to edit online all the time. In practice, I mostly copied and pasted.\nThe problem of creating a training is that I think it’s a lot of work. I never tried, and maybe it’s easier than I think it is, but just getting started seems like a lot.\nInstead of using LinkedIn, a very popular option is to use Medium or, more specifically, “Towards Data Science” (TDS), a subset of Medium articles focused on data science. I frequently find articles I like in TDS, but it’s somewhat pay-walled. You get just a few free articles for free. For authors, the advantages are that TDS is widely promoted in search results and that authors get paid. Not enough to quit a job and write for TDS, but enough to buy a couple books per year. Other options are newsletters, but it starts to feel too much like a job.\nThe LinkedIn algorithm seems to punish posts that only point users to an external article. I can understand that: this type of post is unlikely to generate any engagement inside of LinkedIn: people just “click out”.\nIn any case, the problem I wanted to solve was to be able to write more technical posts from time to time, but still be able to post those to LinkedIn automatically. To write technical posts on my blog, I started using #Quarto and loving it. Recently, I wrote some code to configure Quarto to post automatically to LinkedIn. The code scans my Quarto files and uses the LinkedIn API to post them. If they fit fully as text, it posts them as a normal post. If they’re too large, it posts the beginning of the article and a link to my blog.\nNow, when I write a blog post (technical or non-technical) or even real work code, I can choose to automatically post it to LinkedIn and Twitter by simply adding some front-matter to my file.\nThis solves many problems for me. With that, I now do all my writing in VS Code. I don’t need to use Buffer anymore. I even have version control.\nNow I just need to write interesting stuff!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have recently announced that I’m leaving Amazon and starting a new job (yet to be announced) next week. This means that I have been on the interviewee side of the interview process somewhat recently.\nOne of the most important things to know is that the way of getting better at interviewing is… well, interviewing! It’s good to be on both sides of the table, both as an interviewer and as an interviewee. Practice helps you to do better, but it also helps you see where you’re not doing well.\nI have two policies about interviewing. The first policy is that I will accept an invitation to interview at least once a year, even if I’m happy with my job, which I frequently am. I don’t like wasting people’s time, so it has to be a place that I would really consider going to if the process worked out. The reason for that policy is that I once spent many years without interviewing and when a good opportunity showed up, I was very out of practice, and I think a lot of me not getting it was because I barely understood how the process worked in other companies. I’m not sure I’ll keep this policy.\nThe second policy, which I’m even less sure of its helpfulness, is that once I decide that I’m willing to change jobs, I will be fairly open to interview for lots of different things. For example, if I get invited to interview for my dream job and decide that I would leave my current job for it, I’ll interview for lots of other jobs as well. This gives me a lot of extra work and stress (interviewing is hard), but it also allows me to practice a lot and find my weaker spots, and to have a backup in case things don’t work out.\nOne of the hardest questions for me is “why do you want to leave your current job and join us”. I tend to like the job I have, and also tend to be more forthcoming than the average interviewee. My sincere answer is usually far away from “this is my dream job”. It’s possible that I have only succeeded in my latest interview because it’s a place that I really, really, really love and admire in a company that I love and admire, too. It was sincerely my dream job and team. In any case, after some practice in interviews (and lots of help from Katie Baird, PCC) I started to get better at answering that question, while still being sincere, which led to far more offers/quasi-offers.\nTo wrap this up, I want to recognize that my experience above is one of extreme privilege: I have been around for a long time, and I’m extremely fortunate to be invited to interview. A large number of people are in earlier stages, when even getting an interview is hard. If you are in that situation, I think the takeaway is to still try to get as much practice as you can (by being open even after you’re far into some process, by doing mock interviews in both sides of the table, etc.). I hope your time will come and I hope that I can help."

    "text": "One of my superpowers from my #Amazon review process this year was “Hire and Develop the Best”.\nThis may be because a few years ago, my (then) manager taught me a trick: when in doubt, err on the side of hiring people.\nI looked at my statistics a while back and I really don’t say “yes” that much more than my peers. It’s just a little more. When I shadowed other interviewers, I noticed that my questions are just as hard, if not harder. If I noticed one difference, it’s that I tend to start with a quick, easier question, which usually cost me less than five minutes, and I’m then quickly at or above the average difficulty level of my peer interviewers.\nI do this because it is extremely common for the interviewee to be nervous during an interview. Like on the movie Gladiator, you don’t know what will come out when the gates open, even though you prepared a lot for it. If the first question throws the interviewee off, it’s often hard for them to regain confidence. It’s quicksand.\n\nI like #interview questions that are “adaptive”, like the GMAT, meaning that you can make them easier or harder by changing small things. Sometimes, people would actually be able to do the hard version of the question, but they’re nervous and need to start with the easy one.\nAs commonplace as it is, the interview process is very imperfect, and usually tends to yield false negatives: meaning that it fails people that would have succeeded. Given how hard the process is, people that are “on the margin” are more likely to be good hires than not. I have not regretted any bets I’ve made."

    "text": "Chesterton’s Fence is an extremely important concept, especially if you are joining a new team in a senior or in a leadership position.\nThe concept dates from around 1929. The original text is longer, but a concise version is: “Do not take a fence down if you don’t know why it was put up in the first place.”\nNew managers and senior resources frequently want to change a lot of things. We are, after all, hired because of our deep expertise and experience. It’s not uncommon for a senior, experienced person to think that what was done before them was “wrong” and that they could easily do what’s “right”.\nThe reality is that, most times, whomever did the previous version is an accomplished professional had to make lots of decisions under constrained resources. I find that it’s usually hubris from my side to think that I can easily understand and solve all those problems quicker and better than they did. Fences don’t sprout from the ground - there’s a reason why a specific fence was put up there in the first place.\nI frequently learn a lot when trying to understand the reasons why the original decisions were made. Occasionally, the original solution can really be improved on, but after understanding why it was made in the first place I also learn of constraints I didn’t know. In many other cases, I learn of constraints that would actually create significant problems for the new idea I had, and that saves me and everyone else significant time.\nWhen I was less experienced and less careful, I brought down plenty of fences unnecessarily, and was later surprised to find escaped sheep on the road and farmers yelling at me.\nI also posted about other concepts, such as the XY Problem and Cunningham’s Law. I even keep a list of my favorite concepts!"

    "text": "Gather close as I tell you another cautionary tale about data science.\nThe finance team of a company was trying to forecast their monthly cash. An analyst had been doing that for about ten years, and had a record of cash actually received per month going back all those years. He realized that some months, like December, received a lot more cash than others, like February.\nThe analyst used Excel to calculate the percentage change for each month. For example, if the company received $100M in October 2009 and $80M in November 2009, he recorded -20% for Nov 2009. To calculate November 2021, he would take the average of the percentage changes for November over the last 10 years (2011 to 2020) and apply it to the October 2020 number.\nIt didn’t work too well. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was around 20%. For some months, the forecast missed by a lot, causing significant problems, including having to urgently borrow cash at significant cost. Eventually, the company decided to hire a data science consulting company.\nThe consulting company immediately concluded that the problem was due to lack of data. Ten years of monthly data resulted in just 120 data points. To do data science, they said, they needed more than that. Luckily, the analyst had also been recording the daily data. Now, with thousands of data points, the consulting company used an LSTM deep learning model to forecast cash by day. It also didn’t work too well, but when they aggregated it by month, it did a lot better than the analyst’s original forecast: MAPE was closer to 10%.\nThe project was celebrated as a success. A press release was issued, promoting the benefits of using cloud technologies and deep learning for more accurate financial forecasting. The person who hired the consultants was promoted.\nA few months later, a new data scientist joined the company, looked at the monthly data, and used the Excel FORECAST.ETS function to achieve a MAPE of 1% in seconds. This time, there was no press release.\nWhen starting a data science project, be careful about the baseline you’re using to determine success. Choosing a poor baseline (like the original analyst model) can result in thinking that fairly bad outcomes (like the one from the LSTM model) are good, just because they’re better than horrible outcomes. I’ve seen a number of cases in which a simple heuristic handily beat a complicated ML model."

I find that it works in a lot of other interactions, including work interactions.\nCunningham’s Law is frequently presented as a way to exploit a bias that people potentially have against “things being wrong”. While the “bias exploitation” story may be true, there’s also an economic reason why using Cunningham’s Law is a nice thing to do.\nA common example of when posting the wrong answer is expected is in Stack Overflow: when asking your question, it’s a good practice to show what you already tried and what’s not working (essentially posting the wrong answer).\nThe advantage of such a protocol is that it makes it easier on the people trying to help. Consider the example “Who is Luke’s father?”. Asked as a question, there’s a lot of context missing: Luke the Apostle? Luke Skywalker? Luke Wilson? My neighbor Luke?\nOn the other hand, the incorrect statement “Han Solo is Luke’s father” provides a lot of additional context: this is about Star Wars, and it also provides how the question asker expects the answer to look like. Economically, it lowers the production cost of an answer, making it easier to get one.\n… and if there’s something wrong with my theory above, I’m sure someone is going to correct me!"

Perversely, high-performance ICs that become manager have a handicap: they are usually a lot faster than their (new) direct reports.

In addition to 1:1s, managers also spend time talking to a whole lot of other people: their own managers, clients (internal and/or external), partner teams, suppliers, HR, Finance, recruiting. They also represent their team in planning meetings and review meetings. All those conversations add up, as it can be seen in a sample manager calendar below, in which all purple meetings are conversations with other people.\n\nWith that much pressure on their calendars, it’s no surprise that managers give a lot of value to meeting efficiency.

    "text": "You are your team’s top recruiter\nAs hard as it is to coordinate a large team, having a shorthanded team is a lot worse. There are many reasons for a team to be shorthanded: people can leave for several reasons (competing offers, going back to school, etc.) or the team’s mission and scope may grow.\nIn any case, the sooner a manager can fill an opening with quality, the least they have to endure disruption to their time and to their team. Experienced managers develop large and deep networks, both internally and externally.\nThe external network allows managers to recruit external candidates more quickly and to keep a pulse in the job market. The internal network is important for several reasons: the first and more obvious is to find internal candidates, which tend to require less ramp-up.\nA second reason is that a lot of a team’s work depends on other teams. One way to develop these internal networks is to help fellow managers hire: experienced interviewers are always in demand. A final, but important reason: managers occasionally find themselves on the other side of the interview table, and having a good networks helps finding good seats."

As a manager, your team will make commitments, and other teams will make commitments to your team. A lot of a manager’s time is prioritizing and keeping track of all these commitments, and a perhaps surprising portion of the time is spent renegotiating them.\nGiven the importance of tracking commitments, a large part of the management literature and tooling is dedicated to that topic. Different teams will have access to different tools and methodologies. Like the old adage “failing to plan is planning to fail”, having a process and tool is usually far better than having none.\nA consistent process will outlive tools. I have been using the #ad Getting Things Done process for many years, but I have implemented it over several different tools during that period: Jira, Azure DevOps, Microsoft Tasks, OneNote, Quip, Wunderlist and many others."

    "text": "Your tech growth will be slower\nWith all the time spent in meetings, recruiting and commitment tracking, there will be a lot less time left to learn new technologies. The longer someone spends in management, the more they have to move to the nitty-gritty details of existing and new technologies to the 30,000-foot strategic view of a technology’s application.\nThis is perhaps the most important trade-off of choosing a tech management career. Experience with managerial tasks, or “seat time” matters a lot for success as a manager, but once one moves to a management position, lot of time that could be spent learning technologies and techniques will be consumed by meetings, recruiting and commitment tracking.\nMove into management too early and one’s experience may have to rely more on “seat time” instead of “tech depth”. Take too long to move and one may have enough “tech depth” to be frustrated at their team members lack of expertise, and may not have the “seat time” required to be an efficient manager for them.\n\nIt’s not all unicorns and rainbows, but there’s a lot of good\nI found that I derive a lot more pleasure at telling somebody that they got the job that they applied for than from getting a new job myself. A similar thing happened when telling somebody that they got a promotion. And when somebody’s article got accepted to a conference. And in many other similar things.\nI found that I enjoyed helping others succeed through early experiences with mentorship, before I became a manager. Being a manager is living vicariously and enjoying it. It’s not that I don’t enjoy being personally successful, but being a part of great teams and helping them succeed brought me more happiness than I think I could have found on my own.\nWhen you feel the same, it’s worth it trying it out."

This may not be representative of all managers, but once a manager has a team of size 10+, they may need lots of meetings to: - connect with members of their team for both ongoing work and career development - understand what clients want - synchronize with other internal teams we depend on - perform recruiting activities (interviewing, panels, presentations) - meetings with their own managers - meetings with peers to ensure we’re learning from each other\nI am an extreme introvert, and try really hard to avoid low-value meetings. But I still do 30+ hours. So if you want to be a manager, you need to like (or at least be able to endure) talking to people for a long time each week."

    "text": "Why we do technical phone screens\nImagine you come back hungry from a longer-than-expected trip, open the fridge and find an open bottle of milk. Do you sniff it first to make sure it’s not spoiled or drink it outright?\nSniffing tends to be the lower cost solution. It’s an imperfect solution, as maybe you’ll find tomorrow that the milk was spoiled but wasn’t stinky yet. However, if the milk is spoiled and already stinky, sniffing it is a lot less disgusting than taking a sip.\nThe phone screen is a sniff test. It is imperfect, it may be a bad experience, but it has a much lower cost than an interview. Although we occasionally use information from the phone screen in further steps of the hiring process, the main goal of a phone screen is to assess whether a candidate has a chance to pass the on-site interview.\nGiven the potential high costs of a false positive in a phone screen, interviewers that do phone screens tend to be more experienced than the average on-site interviewer. It’s also common for the hiring manager to be a phone screener. A phone screen can sometimes be the hardest interview in the whole process."

    "text": "When is a phone screen successful?\nThere’s only one clear and obvious case when the technical phone screen is not successful: a candidate passes the phone screen but fails hard at the interview. In that case, people in the interview panel may be annoyed at the phone screener.\nThere are several other outcomes that won’t be judged as harshly: the candidate fails the interview but just barely, the candidate fails the interview for that position but is a good fit for another, the candidate fails the interview for that position level but can be hired at a lower level. The phone screener won’t get called out on those.\nIt’s a lot harder to see failures when the candidate is rejected at the phone screen interview, as it’s harder to track what happened to the candidate. There are several cases of developers failing a phone screen in a company and being hired (and becoming very successful) in another, sometimes more prestigious, company.\nNote that the incentives are biased towards phone screeners rejecting more candidates than they should. This is a good reason to have phone screen interviewers be more experienced people (who may care less about other people being annoyed at them) or the hiring manager, who would take more risk to hire candidates.\nI have no scientific basis or good data for my next statement, but I think that regardless of the incentives above, phone screens still tend towards having more false negatives, that is, they reject people that would do well."

    "text": "How people fail phone screens\n\nCheating\nOne of the defining characteristics of phone screens is that they are remote. Therefore, it’s easier to cheat on them. The whole interviewing process is grueling, and the benefits of passing are pretty great, so I do understand why people want to cheat. I imagine it even works for some people. When it doesn’t work, however, it’s pretty bad.\n\nAs is widely known, lot of technical interview questions and their answers are available on LeetCode. Some interviewers use LeetCode questions, but adapt them for the phone screen interview, usually with good intentions: adding simplifying conditions to make the question easier and therefore making it possible to complete the question during a phone screen.\nWhen cheating candidates hear the question and search for it in LeetCode, they are usually elated to find the answer and gleefully type it pretending that they’re thinking about it on the spot. However, since the question was adapted, the LeetCode answer doesn’t work, it doesn’t even make any sense: it solves a different, more complex problem than the one being asked.\nAlthough the consequences may vary, they are at best the same as being eliminated by simply failing. If the candidate were to try to answer the question normally, they would probably do much better.\n\n\nLying on their resumes\nIf the position requires SQL or some programming language, you are likely to be asked questions about SQL or that programming during the phone screen. I have seen candidates apply to positions that require SQL, write that they know SQL in their resume, get to the phone screen, and then say that they don’t know SQL when asked basic questions.\nThe rational explanation I can come up with is that these candidates are hoping for a false positive. As bad as the interview process is, it’s more likely to generate false negatives than false positives, and I think a candidate would have better chances playing the lottery.\n\n\nNot talking through their thinking\nThe candidate is asked a question, but actually doesn’t know exactly how to solve it. Maybe they are nervous and forgot not only the syntax but even some concepts. Maybe they aren’t as experienced as their resume led the recruiters to believe.\nBy talking through their thinking, candidates can show that they know something, and would usually get some hints if they’re going in the right direction. However, at least once a quarter I have some candidate that becomes absolutely silent instead of talking through what they’re thinking and eventually gives up. This makes it hard to help these candidates."

I chose a LeetCode problem and presented the solution to them. They were paired up such that half of them were interviewers, half of them were assigned to be candidates. The interviewers asked the same question that everybody had just seen to the “candidates”. The interviews were recorded and the “candidates” and interviewers were told that the recordings would be shown to students and some of their colleagues. This last part was a trigger: this was supposed to make the “candidates” nervous and self-conscious.\nThe question was a LeetCode “easy” question. The “candidates” were senior developers and they had seen the answer minutes before. Regardless, 3 of them (60%) couldn’t complete the question in 20 minutes with hints. The remaining 2 “candidates” needed hints to finish. All of them missed some key detail.\nRegardless, they would all pass a phone screen."

    "text": "How people pass phone screens\n\nThey communicate\nMost candidates I see passing phone screens first restate the problem in their own words to make sure they understand it, clearly state any assumptions they are making, and then talk through their strategy to solve it. They check with the interviewer if their understanding, assumptions and strategy make sense. It is easier to fix problems in the beginning rather than after they start coding.\n\n\nThey are organized\nWhile I understand a candidate will be very nervous during a phone screen and that is likely going to make it harder for them to organize their thinking, I think the strategies below will help them calm down and still be able to organize their thinking.\n\nThey comment their code: I wish I saw more comments in production. Of course, I wish I saw more comments in interviews. These comments may help you structure your thinking better and not forget things.\nThey use meaningful function and variable names: I wish I saw more meaningful names in production code. Of course, I wish I saw more meaningful names in interviews. This will help you remember what your code is supposed to do, and it will also help the interviewer understand what you’re trying to do and help you.\n\n\n\nThey don’t try to show perfection during the phone screen\nI always try to tell my candidates that I don’t expect perfection, using different words. Although perfection may happen - I see it about once a year - most candidates will not get the answers completely correct. They will forget some condition, have some syntax problem, provide a solution that is not optimal. That’s usually ok.\nTrying to be perfect is likely to make candidates focus on the wrong things during the interview and get nervous if they can’t be perfect at that time, which will in turn prevent them from showing a lot of things that they’re perfectly good at."

This doesn’t help these candidates, for reasons I explained before and that I’ll summarize below.\nImagine there are two identical candidates that qualify for the position. Candidate A applies immediately. Candidate B sends a message asking the hiring manager to review their CV or profile before they apply, and perhaps also asks to meet.\nUsually, the reason why the hiring manager is hiring is because there’s more work to be done than their team can currently handle. So the hiring manager is likely to be very busy, and it will take some time for them to answer. Their calendar may be super full.\nBy the time the manager finally answers, even if the answer is “yes, your basic qualifications match what was posted in the position”, Candidate A is probably already doing their phone screen. By the time Candidate B meets with the hiring manager to decide whether to apply, Candidate A is receiving an offer.\nIn addition, after all that effort, the hiring manager could observe that Candidate B didn’t read instructions attentively, needs help with very simple tasks, and does not show “bias for action”.\nI have a keyboard shortcut that essentially types: “If you fit the basic qualifications and the position interests you, just apply directly through the link I provided”.\nThat approach works for me because of my particular situation: many good candidates, attractive company, lots of positions. In other situations (e.g., a smaller company) I’d probably have another approach: for example, I might offer to review resumes.\nThe key point is to interact with the hiring manager in the way they are suggesting. They are trying to help you succeed. If they’re suggesting you should apply, then apply. If they’re asking for you to send them a resume or reply with “Interested”, then that’s the best approach."

I think that’s a very cool idea for the Economics of information. For an extreme case, imagine you have a trade secret that allows you to solve a specific class of problems faster than others. In this case, it’s understandable that you want to keep the trade secret to yourself. But it makes sense to advertise to the world that you can quickly solve some kinds problems faster than others. That makes your trade secret more valuable."

    "text": "The discipline of writing about what you’re doing\nWhen I was a wee little kid and had just entered college, one of my first classes was “Physics Lab”, and the first class of that was to measure “gravity”, more specifically, the gravitational acceleration . Of course, mathy Computer Science studies that we were, we all knew that the gravitational acceleration would be \\(g \\approx 9.8 m/s^2\\).\nMeasuring it, however, it’s not very easy. First, remember that this is in the early 90s in Brazil, so digital cameras were very rare. Part of the problem is that 9.8 meters (approximately 30 feet) is quite high, so if we wanted our experiment to take around 1s, we would need a big ladder. Or, as it happened, we’d need to run an experiment that took less than a second for each run. In a class with 25 students, that was the preferred route.\nWe set up a vertical track attached to a device that would spark every 1/60 of a second, and we attached grid paper to the track. This is called a Behr free fall apparatus.\nWe would release the device from the top of the track, and the sparks would mark the grid paper. We would then manually measure the distances between the sparks and the differences between the distances would tell us the acceleration. In theory. Again, remember this is the early 90s, so there’s no Windows 95 or Excel easily available, there were several steps that were prone to error.\nThe desired outcome was not only to calculate the acceleration due to gravity, but also to generate a lab report."

Oh boy. We quickly found out that the best lab reports were the ones in which the experimenter would document the experiment as they were executing the experiment. Another thing that worked was going through the experiment more than once. What did not work was to perform the experiment and then go to where the computers were to type up a report from memory.\nI thought that was very insightful, shortly afterwards, we would learn about Donald Knuth’s proposed paradigm of literate programming, which lives on in Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown and that is very popular in data science today. Behind it is the same concept of explanations interspersed with technical work to produce something that is reproducible and easy to understand."

David argues that aspiring data scientists should blog for technical practice, to build a portfolio, and to get feedback. Experienced data scientists might benefit for similar reasons, but not exactly the same.\nSimilar to “practicing”, blogging about technical topics helps you learn how to communicate better about them, and also helps you learn how to write better research reports. Similar to “portfolio”, it signals a data scientist’s body of work. For an early-in-career data scientist, it may be more showing that you can do analysis, but for an experienced data scientist is more about what type of analysis you like to do. Finally, I think that “feedback” also works differently for early-in-career and experienced data scientists. I’m not sure random strangers in the internet will sweep in and correct your posts, but you can find out what people are reading and sharing. You may be surprised when you learn what parts of your work people find interesting."

    "section": "Azure Functions v2",
    "text": "Azure Functions v2\nMicrosoft recently released a Python worker for the Azure Functions runtime v2. As of this writing (2018-08-23), both Azure Functions v2 and the python worker are in “preview mode”. The Azure Functions v1 runtime supports development and hosting only in the portal or on Windows. The v2 runtime runs on .NET Core, and therefore can run on Windows, macOS and Linux. Microsoft provides a set of tools based on Node.JS and .NET Core that make it easy to develop in any platform. That takes care of objectives #1, #3 and #6. Although knocking off three objectives simply by selecting Azure Functions v2 sounded very promising to begin with, that’s as many objectives as I could achieve.\n\nLinux host\nRegardless of the platform you develop on, Python function apps need to be hosted on Azure Functions on Linux. Running on Linux has a couple downsides:\n\nYou have to access the Azure Portal using a secret code to enable Azure to offer Linux hosts\nAs of this writing (2018-08-23), Linux hosts can only be dedicated. Azure Functions can normally run in two modes: “Consumption” and “Dedicated”. Consumption is virtually free, but the “dedicated” mode costs approximately $35 per month for the cheapest version. According to the README the “Consumption” mode is upcoming, and I have a small allowance due to my MSDN subscription, so I caved.\n\nAnd there goes objective #2. But it seems temporary, so we’re probably good.\n\n\nDeveloping a Slack Bot\nA Slack bot is essentially an HTTP server that will receive JSONs and perform actions through HTTP requests. Azure Functions have an HTTP Trigger template, so this takes care of most of the plumbing. I created a Slack app using the instructions here. This bot subscribes to events, which are sent to an URL. I’ve created the HTTP Server that provides that URL using the instructions on how to create a function using the command line interface, and creating a sample based on the HttpTrigger.\nSpecifically, my Azure Function receives JSONs for each message, parses them to see if they have a :stroopwafel:, and if they do, parses the mentions (@user) in the message. For each mention, we log a :stroopwafel: gift in a database, from which we can build reports at the end of a period.\n\n\nPyODBC\nThe original idea was tha whenever a message mentioned a :stroopwafel:, the bot would use pyodbc to save the message in a database. Databases are usually not free, but Azure offers SQL Server for as low as $5 per month, and that seemed acceptable. The problem is that pyodbc does not have a linux wheel, and currently Azure Functions for Linux requires wheels. There’s a way of compiling the package on the fly, but it currently has a bug. And I don’t know how long it will take to fix that bug.\nI searched for alternatives to PyODBC, and the best alternative was to use Cosmos DB, since its Python package pydocumentdb has a wheel. The downside is that the cheapest Cosmos DB plan as of this writing costs $25. And now we’re far away from objective #2, and we’re also not doing great with objective #4. However, I found Cosmos DB a pleasure to use.\n\n\nGitHub\nOnce I was done with my development, which Azure Functions Core Tools made really convenient by setting a local test server whenever I run func host start, I pushed my repository to GitHub and configured the Azure Function app to consume it using Continuous Deployment, which is something that you can set up in Azure with just a few clicks. However, it doesn’t yet work (sad trombone). Luckily, deploying without GitHub is not that bad. Again, Azure Functions Core Tools provides a command-line interface utility that pushes your application to the server: func azure functionapp publish &lt;app-name&gt;, and you’re done in a couple of minutes. But I also don’t fulfill objective #5."

It does a lot of the hard work for you, and if you’re familiar with one of the many languages available, you can deploy your program to production really fast. I had never developed a Slack bot before, and I’ve started the bot during a sleepless night and finished it in an afternoon. All in, it took me less than two days of work to get an app to production. There are still some kinks to be worked out but Azure Functions v2 has already proved to be useful to me.\nI wrote about Azure Functions before, specifically about using Python in Azure Functions v1. Azure Functions can be very useful for Data Scientists: it’s an easy way to deploy a model to production, perform scheduled maintenance, update datasets on a schedule, etc. With v2, Python became a first class player. I’m sure I’ll use it a lot."

    "section": "Should data science teams be centralized or distributed?",
    "text": "Should data science teams be centralized or distributed?\nI was happy to find that Jonathan Nolis has the same opinion as I do: that a data science team works best when distributed into client areas. In addition, we agree that if you distribute your data science team among several different client areas, you have to find a way of keeping the data scientists feeling as if they’re part of a cohesive group. And that’s hard.\nFor me, a key part of the argument to distribute data scientists in client areas relies on Drew Conway’s (ancient) Data Science Venn diagram.\n\n\n\nData Science Venn Diagram\n\n\nAssigning data scientists to a client area will help build the “Substantive Expertise” part of the diagram. A common trap here is “Well, we can do the same if we keep the data scientists centralized and give them specializations that match the client areas.”\nAlthough I think that can work, I worry about what happens when data scientists have downtime.\n\nIncentives for client areas and centralized data science teams\nIn my observations (low sample size), the client areas usually have a better sense of ROI1 - if they invest resources on something, they expect returns. On the other hand, most centralized data science teams I’ve seen have two problems: data scientists hired without a clear purpose and an incentive to overengineering: a current example is to use Deep Learning where a regression would do.\n\n\n\nOverengineering\n\n\nIt may be simply that client areas are more mature and battle worn than centralized data science groups, at least in my experience. I think that if a data scientist is assigned to a client area and there’s downtime, they’ll put the data scientist to work in business intelligence or decision analysis. On the other hand, if the data scientist is assigned to a centralized data science group, they’ll be pulled into a project away from their “client area specialization” or will find a way to work in something novel that’s cool (as of 2018, autoencoders, GANs or something with “Bayesian” in its name).\nAnd here the ROI appears again: as the data scientist works through the BI project, they’ll learn more about the data and more about the business and its data, and that investment has a large likelihood of return in their next project in the same group. Whereas if they spend this time learning a new technique, the return is uncertain.\n\n\nBut wait, if you do that, data scientists will never learn something new\nHere’s where the hard part of keeping a data scientist community pays off. That community may be weekly “Lunch & Learns” if the number of data scientists is small, or quarterly conferences if the number of data scientists is very big and your company is very, very rich.\nIf you don’t forcefully push towards having such a community, it’s very likely that data scientists will reinvent the wheel over and over again, and if their time is as precious as their high salary indicates, that will be a waste of money. For example, if you have 5 data scientists It’s better to spend $50k on travel to bring them together a few times a year than to have one of them wasting three months reinventing something that another of them already done.\n\n\nWhere I disagree with Jonathan Nolis\nIn the podcast, Jonathan suggests that the data scientists should be assigned to client areas and report “solid line” to a Chief Data Scientist, while reporting “dotted line” to the client areas. I would do the opposite. However, listening to the podcast, it seems that Jonathan didn’t have a strong opinion that one is better than the other, and again in agreement, neither do I.\nOne big advantage of having a “solid line” group of data scientists is career advancement. It’s easier to compare data scientists with other data scientists. Leaving them in the client areas will require to compare them with other members of the client area, and they may be seen as wizards (and overvalued) or “too hard to understand”, and be undervalued.\nOne disadvantage is estimating the value of the data scientist to the client area. Data scientists that are more creative in their value calculations or less scrupulous are probably going to get ahead. I’ve lost count of the times that a data science project saved more revenue than the customer ever had.\n\n\nSo, what do I do?\nHonestly, if you’re starting a data science team, your best bet is to hire someone like Jonathan or Drew Conway to plan the team for you. You’re going to spend a lot of money on Data Science, and it’s important to make sure that it will be well spent.\nIf you’re on a budget and all you can invest is the time to read some blog posts, well… you probably don’t have enough money to hire data scientists. But if you do, I recommend assigning them to the client areas and keeping them there. Even when they’re not doing modeling or machine learning, they’re learning more about the business and its data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In October 2023, lots of people with ADHD started posting about their experiences on Threads. Have you ever commuted to work and forgot to bring your laptop? Check. Do you frequently procrastinate a simple two-minute task for several days? Check.\nAs I started seeing a lot of myself in their experiences, and realized that I developed several coping mechanisms and acquired several coping technologies over time, I decided to go for a full diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis is a work in progress and it’s still being updated as I go through the process.\nI am not a doctor. I am a computer scientist and economist. This is not medical advice. If you suspect you have ADHD, you should talk to a medical professional, like I did.\n\n\n\nSymptoms\nWhether I have ADHD or not, I do have some symptoms that are commonly associated with ADHD:\n\nDifficulty getting started with tasks, even simple ones. I have gone to appointments I didn’t need to because I didn’t want to call to cancel the appointment.\nDifficulty putting the finishing touches on tasks. It takes me 90% of the time to do 90% of the work, and 90% of the time to do the remaining 10% of the work.\nI lose an incredible amount of things. When I was a kid, my mom was once told that about 10% of the items of the lost and found in a 300-student school were mine.\nI have a hard time focusing on things that are not interesting to me.\nI oscillate between hyperfocus and not being able to focus at all.\n\nDespite the difficulties, I manage to function well, because I developed a lot of coping mechanisms and technologies over the years.\n\n\nWhy I Decided to Get Tested\nThe flurry of posts in Threads due to the ADHD awareness month in October 2023 got me started. Several posts described experiences that were very similar to mine. A particular story that resonated a lot with me was the story of someone who was treated for anxiety for years when they in fact had ADHD, and only got diagnosed in their 40s.\nI found out that this is a common problem. I have been undergoing treatment for anxiety, and though there was some improvement, progress has been slow. Several posts described a situation similar to mine: people that made little progress while being treated for anxiety, but once diagnosed with and treated for ADHD as adults, their situation improved significantly.\nThis gave me hope, prompting me to research the diagnostic process. Starting the process ended up being more confusing than helpful. The information I found online described several different processes and tests, some of which even seemed to promise a diagnostic outcome. The best advice came from Threads and it was clear: begin by consulting a medical professional and expressing your concerns, and go from there.\n\n\nThe Referral\nThe process, at least where I live, seems to be designed to make it hard for people with ADHD to get diagnosed. I had to go through several steps, and I’m still not done. I live in the state of Washington in the United States. The experience may be different in other states or countries.\nAs mentioned above, the first step is to talk to a medical professional. I had a previously scheduled appointment for my annual physical just a few weeks after I decided to get tested, so I waited for that appointment in mid-October. Trying to schedule a separate appointment would have taken a lot longer.\nIn the appointment, my PCP told me they would call me with a referral in a couple of days, but instead of calling me, they called my emergency contact, who forgot to tell me about it. Luckily, people in Threads kept reminding me to follow up, and I called my PCP office a few days later. I found the referral and called the psychologist office.\n\n\nThe Initial Evaluation\nI called the psychologist’s office in early November. The first thing I needed to do was to set up an account in their system, which took a few days. Then, when the account was completed, they asked me to fill several standard medical forms, plus a two-page biography describing why I think I may have ADHD, and three questionnaires designed to assess whether I have ADHD and potentially autism, which tends to happen hand-in-hand. The questionnaires are below:\n\nAdult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS)\nBrown ADD Scales\nAutism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)\n\nThe first questionnaire is a screening tool for ADHD. The second is a more detailed questionnaire about ADHD symptoms. The third is a screening tool for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a common comorbidity. The first six questions serve as a screening tool: if you score in the grey areas for four out of the six questions, you should definitely talk to a medical professional.\nI completed the forms December 8th. After all the forms are filled, there are three more appointments to go through, and the first can only be scheduled after the forms are completed. I received a message on the day after that I should schedule the first appointment. I only managed to call back on December 22nd, and scheduled the first evaluation for January 3rd, 2024.\n\n\nThe First Meeting\nOn Jan 3rd, 2024, I had the first meeting with the psychologist. We introduced ourselves and he asked me about the symptoms that resulted in me seeking a diagnosis. I described the symptoms I listed above, and he asked me to elaborate on each one of them. He also asked me about my childhood, and I described how I was a very good student, but I had a hard time focusing on things that were not interesting to me. I also described how I lost a lot of things, and how I had a hard time getting started with tasks.\nHe asked about my family history. My mom is definitely not neurotypical, but she has never sought a diagnosis. I did not have enough contact with my dad to know if he was neurotypical or not. He also asked about my children, and I told him that their school has guided me to request accomodation arrangements for them (these are called 504s). I told him that I plan to get them through an ADHD and autism evaluation as well and that the school counselor had already suggested that earlier in the year.\nHe then gave me three more tests to fill out on my own time, which I did later at night on that same day.\n\nA personality test with over 250 questions. The test asked a lot about whether I can control other people’s minds, whether I think they control my mind, and how frequently I think about suicide. It also repeated several questions about the usual ADHD symptoms. It would ask “Do you always feel distracted?” and offer four options for me to choose (False, Slightly True, Mostly True, True). Later, it would ask “Do you frequently feel distracted?”, and show the four options again. This one took a while to get through.\n[The Big Five personality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits): A standard personality test with about 50 questions, which was somewhat quick to get through.\nAn attention test called IVA-AE2 that simultaneously shows an image of a number and speaks another number. For example, it can show 2 and speak “six”. You are assigned two different target numbers, one to click when you see it and another to click when you hear it. It then speaks and shows numbers for 20 minutes. I think it’s pretty normal to make the mistake of clicking when you hear the number you’re supposed to click only when you see and vice-versa, and I’m sure I made plenty of mistakes, but I think most people would. This test was very tiring.\n\nThe whole meeting lasted about 40 minutes. We scheduled the appointment for the second meeting on January 8th, 2024.\n\n\nCoping Technologies\nOver time I acquired a lot of products to help me cope with the symptoms. I will list them below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLinks to Amazon.com are affiliate links. These help the site stay online.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft To-Do: I use Microsoft To-Do to keep track of tasks. I like it because it’s very simple, it’s multiplatform, so I can see and check tasks from my phone, my computer and my watch. Since it integrates well with Siri, I can add tasks simply by saying ‘Hey Siri, remind me to X’, which helps me keep track of things. I specifically add tasks to my to-do list as I’m starting them, because that will help me remember to finish if I get distracted.\nApple AirTags: I have these on everything since I lose something almost daily. The new AirTags have a feature called Precision Finding that allows me to find things a lot faster, and I use it a lot.\nWallet with keyring: A wallet with an attached keyring allows me to carry my badge, car and house keys, wallet, and an AirTag all together, making it hard for me to lose things.\nS-biner carabiners: I use these to attach things to my backpack and to each other, so I have only one bundle of items to keep track of.\nRay-Ban Meta: works as a headset and as reading glasses. It also has a camera, which I use quite a lot, and an AI that I don’t use as much yet.\nReMarkable 2: during the years, I had (and lost) many notebooks and loose sheets of paper. The ReMarkable2 is an e-ink notebook that feels like a real notebook, but has a lot of capacity. I can also carry academic papers on it.\nPillbox: I use a pillbox to organize my vitamins and medications. I usually forget whether I took the medication or not a few hours after the time I was supposed to take it, so I use the pillbox to keep track of whether I took it or not.\n\n\n\nReactions\nI posted about my experience in Threads, and I got a lot of reactions. Most people are supportive and describe their own experiences being diagnosed. Some people, however, are skeptical. They say that ADHD is overdiagnosed, and that it’s a fad, or a quick excuse to be lazy and forgetful. While I disagree, I have seen some websites that promise a “quick and easy” diagnosis and to get you medications fast. It feels similar to advertisements for Viagra and off-label Ozempic.\n\n\nWhat about you?\nIf you suspect you may have ADHD, I recommend that you talk to a medical professional. Your PCP is a good place to start. Online communities, such as the ones in Threads, can also be a good place to start."

She will go into hunger strikes for an extended period of time if she dislikes the food. The first brand that worked reliably for us was The Farmer’s Dog. The main drawback of that food is that it’s wet and frozen. It takes a fair amount of freezer space, the kids don’t like to handle it, it’s hard to travel with. We tried a few other brands, but none of them worked. Then we found Badlands Ranch, a dry food funded by the actress Katherine Heigl, and decided to give it a try.\nYou can order the food on their website.

My dog is 40 lbs, and she needs 2.5 cups per day, so each package lasts only 4 days.\nThe food is expensive: if you buy the 6-bag bundle, it’s $203.70 for 60 cups, or $3.40 per cup. That’s $8.50 per day for my dog. Blue Buffalo food, a premium brand of wet food, is about $6.50 per day for my dog.\n\nHowever, my dog reliably likes it. Because it’s dry food, we can travel with it. It’s fairly calorie-dense, so it’s easy to carry a few days worth of food in a small bag. It’s also easy to store, and it doesn’t smell. The kids feed the dog without complaining, and the dog eats mostly without complaining, so it works well for us. Unless we’re eating pizza, in which case the dog will refuse to eat anything else. But you can’t blame her for that."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Do you want to start journaling in the new year? Tired of carrying notebooks around? Maybe you just want your notes to be more organized?\nThe reMarkable is a tablet with an e-ink display, similar to the Kindle. It is designed to be used with a stylus, and it is marketed as a paper replacement. Contrary to other tablets, if feels like paper.\nI got myself a reMarkable 2 in their Black Friday promotion, after having seen a colleague at work using it. Before having a reMarkable, I used a large number of disorganized Moleskines and loose paper sheets. A lot of loose paper sheets.\nI have been using the reMarkable 2 for a little over a month, and I am happy with it. I have used it for taking notes in meetings, for journaling, and for writing down ideas. I have also used it for reading PDFs and ebooks. But it’s not without its issues.\n\nWhat problems I want to solve?\nThese days, I can take handwritten notes in most of my devices. My main device is a Surface Laptop Studio 2, which folds into a tablet and has a stylus. I also have an iPad Pro 13” with a stylus, but my Surface mostly replaced it. However, I cannot do everything with my Surface Laptop Studio 2. Here are a few of its problems:\n\nIt is a little on the heavy side. It is heavier than the iPad Pro 13”, that many people already find too heavy for handwritten notes.\nBattery life is not great. I can get about 2-3 hours of battery life out of it, which is not enough for a full day of meetings.\nIt is easy to get distracted by notifications and other apps on the device.\n\n\n\nHow does the reMarkable 2 solve these problems?\nThe reMarkable 2 solves these problems in the following ways:\n\nThe reMarkable 2 is very light. It is 403 grams (0.9 pounds) and 4.7 mm (0.2 inches) thick. For comparison, my iPad Pro 13” is 682 grams (1.5 pounds) and 5.9 mm (0.23 inches) thick.\nIt has no distractions. It is designed to be used for reading and writing, and it does not have a web browser or any other apps. It is very easy to focus on what you are doing.\nIt has a very long battery life. I find myself charging it about once or twice a week depending on how much I use it. It charges via USB-C, which is easily available.\n\n\n\nWhat is the reMarkable 2 useful for?\nI have been using the reMarkable 2 for the following use cases:\n\nAcademic paper reading and annotation: This was my intended use case for the reMarkable 2. The reMarkable 2 works, but it’s not ideal. It has a 10.3” screen, smaller than A4 paper, so I find myself reading papers in landscape mode, which makes the text a little bigger, but requires scrolling. In addition, I don’t like the contrast of the reMarkable’s e-ink display very much. It works, but it doesn’t have contrast adjustments, and it’s not as good as the Kindle’s display.\nJournaling: I have been using the reMarkable 2 for journaling almost every day. The writing experience is exceptional. It really feels like writing on paper, and the experience is very smooth.\nNote-taking in meetings: I have taken the reMarkable 2 to meetings, and this allows me to focus a lot better on meetings. The note-taking is superb, and the lack of distractions is great. The apps in the phone and in the PC allows me to easily see and add to my notes.\nWriting down ideas: I have been using the reMarkable 2 for writing down ideas and think about projects. It works well for that because it allows me to capture my ideas in a way that is easy to share and add to them later, without being distracted by technologies. This is specifically useful when I am in a plane or in a bus commuting.\nMany templates: the reMarkable has many paper templates, including lined paper, grid paper, and even music sheets. You can even create your own templates. I used to have more than one notebook for different purposes, and now I can have them all in the same device.\n\n\n\nDownsides\nThe reMarkable 2 is not perfect. Here are some of the downsides:\n\nThe reMarkable 2 is expensive, starting at $299 for the barebones model. You need a pen, and you probably want a cover. You can save money by buying unnoficial pens and covers at Amazon. One of my colleagues likes a $20 pen he bought online. The official pen costs $79 without an eraser and $129 with one. Covers run between $79 (cloth) to $199 (leather, with a keyboard).\nYou cannot sync Kindle e-books to it. You can read PDFs and e-books on it, but you cannot sync your Kindle library to it.\nIts 10” screen is a little small for reading PDFs. I have been reading a lot of academic papers on it, and it’s easier to do it on landscape mode, where it gets a little bigger, but requires scrolling.\nThe lack of contrast is a little annoying. The reMarkable 2 does not have contrast adjustments, and it’s not as good as the Kindle’s display. I find myself looking for better lighting more than I expected.\n\n\n\nDo I recommend it?\nAlthough I’m moderately happy with my reMarkable 2, it’s not for everyone and not for every use case.\nIt replaces my Moleskines and loose paper sheets, but it does not replace my iPad Pro completely: reading Kindle books and academic papers is still better on the iPad Pro.\nReading online reviews, people with ADHD seem to like the reMarkable 2 a lot, because it allows them to focus on what they are doing without distractions. I am not sure yet whether I have ADHD or not, but I likely do, and this may be biasing my opinion towards it.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe reMarkable 2 is, to me, a good replacement for loose paper sheets and Moleskines. A good Moleskine costs $30, so the reMarkable 2, at $299, pays for itself after 10 Moleskines, which is not that far off. It also helps me be more organized, because I can have all my notes in one place, they are always with me and I can easily search them and add to them.\nThe downsides are still problematic, and it may be better to wait for the next version of the reMarkable. It (barely) works for my use cases, but it may not be for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLinks to Amazon.com are affiliate links.

    "title": "Explaining memes and images with the Semantic Kernel and the OpenAI Vision API",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In this article, I’ll explain how to use the Semantic Kernel and the OpenAI Vision API to perform two tasks:\n\nExplain why a meme is funny\nIdentify an animal in an image and pass the results to another function that generates three interesting facts about the animal.\n\nThe examples in this article are intentionally simple. The goal of the article is to give you a good idea of the capabilities of the Semantic Kernel and the OpenAI Vision API. The plugin can be used for more complex tasks, such as figuring out whether a street intersection is accessible to wheelchairs,whether a person is wearing a mask, or to automatically generate accessible image descriptions.\nThe code for all examples can be found in the demo.py source file in the GitHub repository.\n\nExplaining why memes are funny\nIn this first example, I will use the plugin to explain why a meme is funny. My code instantiates and calls the Vision plugin. The plugin has a single function, ApplyPromptToImage, which takes a prompt and an image URL as input, and returns the generated text. In my example, the prompt is simply Why is this meme funny?, and I pass an URL of an image of a meme.\n    \n    kernel = sk.Kernel()\n    vision = kernel.import_skill(Vision())\n\n    meme_base_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucas-a-meyer/lucas-a-meyer.github.io/main/images/\"\n    meme_url_list = [\"meme1.jpg\", \"meme2.png\", \"meme3.jpg\"] \n\n    for url in meme_url_list:\n        variables = sk.ContextVariables()\n        variables['prompt'] = \"Why is this meme funny?\"\n        variables['url'] = meme_base_url + url\n        meme = await kernel.run_async(vision['ApplyPromptToImage'], input_vars=variables)\n        print(f\"{meme}\\n\\n\")     \nHere are the results. The Vision API does a good job of understanding the image and generating a good explanation of why the meme is funny.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeme\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe humor in this meme comes from the irony and self-awareness of the situation. The person in the image is depicted as being awake at 3 AM, a time typically associated with sleep, while reading about the importance of sleep. The implication is that while they understand the value of sleep for health and well-being, they are not following this advice themselves. The relatable contradiction between what they’re doing (staying up late) and what they’re reading about (the importance of sleep) creates a humorous juxtaposition that many people can identify with, as it’s common for individuals to do things that go against their own better judgment or knowledge.\n\n\n\nThis meme is humorous because it presents a situation where someone has comically circumvented a rule through a technicality. The text explains that while there’s a rule against having pumpkins in their dormitory, there’s no mention of pineapples. The images show a pineapple carved in a manner similar to a jack-o’-lantern, traditionally made from a pumpkin, often for Halloween. The humor arises from the person’s literal interpretation of the rules, exploiting the lack of specificity to create a loophole and do something in the spirit of what’s prohibited yet not technically against the rules. This kind of wit and playful rebellion against overly specific or seemingly arbitrary rules often resonates with people who enjoy clever ways to bend or skirt the rules without breaking them.\n\n\n\nThe humor in this meme arises from the juxtaposition of an inspirational saying typically found in areas of the home where food is prepared or consumed—like the kitchen—and placing it in a completely inappropriate context—the bathroom. Specifically, the framed quote says, “LIFE IS SHORT LICK THE BOWL,” which in a culinary context encourages people to enjoy life to the fullest, perhaps by savoring every last bit of their food. However, when placed in the bathroom, right next to a toilet bowl, the phrase takes on a literal and unpleasantly comical meaning. The idea of licking a toilet bowl is both absurd and humorous, evoking a reaction due to the drastic shift in the context of the phrase.\n\n\n\nIn the next section, I’ll explain how to use the plugin to identify an animal in an image and pass the results to another function.\n\n\nChaining the plugin answer to another function\nIn the example below, I first use the Vision plugin to identify an animal, and then use the results to ask for three interesting facts about an animal. I have createad a semantic function with the prompt Provide three interesting and unusual facts about the animal {{$input}} and called it AnimalFacts.\nThe URL I’m passing in the code below is a picture of an owl. The Vision API correctly identifies the animal as an owl, and the AnimalFacts function generates three interesting facts about owls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do this in two steps?\n\n\n\nIn my example, I’m doing two steps. First I’m using the GPT-4 Vision API in the call that identifies the animal from the image, and then GPT-3.5 in the call that generates the facts.\nIt would be possible to solve the problem with a single call to the Vision API, but it can be expensive, so I get its results and pass it to a cheaper model for the text generation step.\n\n\n\nurl = \"https://l.meyerperin.com/skv_owl\"\ngpt35 = OpenAIChatCompletion(\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", api_key, org_id)\nkernel.add_chat_service(\"gpt35\", gpt35)\n\nvision = kernel.import_skill(Vision())\nplugins = kernel.import_semantic_skill_from_directory(\".\", \"plugins\")\n\nvariables = sk.ContextVariables()\nvariables['prompt'] = \"What animal is this? Please respond in one word.\"\nvariables['url'] = url\n\nanimal = await kernel.run_async(vision['ApplyPromptToImage'], input_vars=variables)\nfacts = await kernel.run_async(plugins['AnimalFacts'], input_str=str(animal))\nprint(f\"The animal from the picture is a {animal}\")  \nprint(f\"{facts}\\n\\n\")\nFrom the call above, I got the following result about owls:\n1. Owls have specialized feathers with fringes of varying softness that help muffle \nsound when they fly. Their broad wings and light bodies also make them practically \nsilent fliers, which helps them stalk prey more easily.\n\n2. Unlike most birds, owls have both eyes facing forward which gives them better\n depth perception for hunting.\n\n3. Some species of owls, such as the Great Gray Owl, can hear a mouse moving \nunderneath a foot of snow from up to 60 feet away. Their ears are asymmetrical,\n with one ear being higher than the other, which helps them locate sounds in \n multiple dimensions.\n\n\nHow to write native plugin to wrap the OpenAI API\nIn this section, I’ll explain all the steps involved in writing a Semantic Kernel native Python plugin to wrap the OpenAI API. I’ll use the Vision API as an example. The plugin code is in the GitHub repository.\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom semantic_kernel.skill_definition import sk_function, sk_function_context_parameter\nfrom semantic_kernel.orchestration.sk_context import SKContext\nimport os\nWe need to import the OpenAI library, the SKContext class because our function has multiple parameters (the prompt and the image URL), and the decorators in skill_definition that will allow us to make the Python function visible to the semantic Kernel.\nclass Vision:\n    @sk_function(\n        description=\"\"\"Asks the GPT-4 Vision API to perform an operation described by the prompt\n        on an image given its url\"\"\",\n        name=\"ApplyPromptToImage\"\n    )\n    @sk_function_context_parameter(\n        name=\"prompt\",\n        description=\"The prompt you want to send to the Vision API\",\n    )\n    @sk_function_context_parameter(\n        name=\"url\",\n        description=\"\",\n    )\nThe main code of the function consists in assembling a message that conforms to the Vision API specification. The message is then sent to the API, and the result is parsed and returned to the caller.\n        def ApplyPromptToImage(self, context: SKContext) -&gt; str:\n        load_dotenv()\n        client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))\n\n        response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-4-vision-preview\",\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [\n                {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": f\"{context['prompt']}\"},\n                {\"type\": \"image_url\",\"image_url\": {\"url\": f\"{context['url']}\",\n            },},],}],\n        max_tokens=300,\n        )\n\n        return response.choices[0].message.content\nThe full code for the plugin and associated demo can be found in the GitHub repository.\n\n\nHave I ever thought about creating an app that does this as a service?\nYes, and with the blog post above, you can easily create one yourself. It will probably take you less than an hour to get it working. The main challenge is to bill for it, as the Open AI Vision calls can get expensive very quickly."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, as part of a computer refresh, I have moved from a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 to a Lenovo P51.\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 3 was the right computer for me at the time I got it, but as time went by my position changed substantially, and it ceased to be appropriate for me.\nWhen I got the Surface, the core of my work consisted in traveling, having conference calls and light emailing and spreadsheet work. As time went by, my work went back to creating analytics, creating presentations about analytics, and traveling. There is where the screen of the Surface becomes a liability at 12 inches. I wanted something bigger.\nAnd boy, is the P51 bigger. It has a 15-inch screen and a power brick that alone is twice as heavy as the Surface Pro. It’s big enough to have a keyboard that comes with a numeric keypad. Since I still have to travel a lot, I chose the P51 over the beefier 17-inch P71. The P71 won’t even fit in my somewhat large Osprey backpack. The P51 barely fits.\nDue to some standardization constraints, my P51 is the 1920x1080 version with touch screen. It has 32 Gb of RAM and a 500 Gb SSD. It has the i7 7820HQ running at 2.9 GHz and a Quadro M2200 GPU. If I had the option, I’d choose the 4K screen and the Xeon processor, but I did not have that option.\nThe battery life is surprisingly good. For the kind of things that I do in planes (writing blog posts, editing presentations, light programming), the battery seems to last well over 8h without Wi-Fi and about 7h with Wi-Fi. I have yet to run out of battery in a flight. I have read that the earlier version of the P51, the P50, would trip the circuit breaker of a plane if you tried to plug it in. I have not attempted to plug in the P51 yet.\nThe P51 is usable in the Premium Economy seats and, of course, in business and first class seats, but I have the impression that it would not fit well in the economy class of carriers that have a very small distance between seats (like American Airlines domestic flights), especially if the person in front of you reclines their seat. It works well in exit seats.\nOne gripe I had about the Surface Pro 3 was that I always had to travel with a USB hub, a mouse, and a couple mini-DisplayPort adapters. The P51 comes with a mechanical keyboard, the beloved TrackPoint, a good TouchPad, 4 USB ports, a Thunderbolt 3 port, an Ethernet port, an HDMI port, and, to my surprise, a mini-DisplayPort, so I get to keep all the adapters I had for the Surface.\nI’ve also considered the P51-S. The slimmer version trades off some power (it goes from quad-core to dual-core) for a thinner, lighter frame. I think the P51-S would also have been a solid choice, but I think it would force me to do most of my work from a workstation and/or a server that I’d need to remote into frequently, adding to the stress of versioning and synchronizing. Somewhat counter-intuitively, I chose the heavier computer because I travel a lot, as it has enough power for me to do the vast majority of my work on it and use a server or workstation just for the realhardcore stuff.\nIn summary, the Lenovo P51 is a great computer for the traveling data scientist. It’s powerful enough to be used as your primary machine. For me, it’s near the top limit of a computer that is comfortable to travel with, but still within that limit. I got used to it in no time and completely gave up my desktop workstation."

    "text": "Should we care?\nThere’s a lot of information asymmetry in the Data Science market, the position being so new, and “Michael Spence signaling” matters. Having a “Data Scientist” title from a reputable company is an important signal. For example, a medium-sized company might not be aware that Lyft recently changed their data analysts title to “Data Scientist”\nPart of the problem is that the “Data Scientist” title is itself poorly defined, as shown by the litany of Venn and not-Venn diagrams listed above. A short, non-comprehensive list of alternative titles for Data Scientists I’ve met in the last month:\n\nTableau/Power BI Report Designer\nMachine Learning Researcher\nPython Programmer who knows how to call scikit-learn functions\n\nUsing the same name for vastly different abilities makes matching between employers and employees difficult. In addition, it may make career progression difficult. For example, job responsibilities and objectives are likely to be related to a company’s interpretation of the title of “Data Scientist”. Employees in that company may be “Data Scientists” under other interpretations, and may be really good, but may have their performance evaluated under different guidelines: “I know your ML model saved $1B for our company, but the color scheme of your Tableau reports is horrible!” As per the (not really) Albert Einstein’s quote “(…) if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.”"

    "text": "Conway’s Venn to the rescue!\nHere’s where I think Conway’s Venn diagram comes to the rescue in a useful way. We could rule out the Tableau Designer if they lack programming or statistical skills. We could rule out the ML Researcher if they don’t have domain expertise. We could rule out the Python programmer if they don’t know Math and/or have domain expertise. Perhaps this makes Data Scientists hard to find (it would justify their salary)!\nDepending what the company you work for was before the Data Science profession started, a lot of people from different jobs may have re-branded themselves as data scientists. I think Conway’s diagram is helpful as it points to where people should focus their development in order to be more effective as data scientists. For example, former Economists most likely need more hacking skills, former computer scientists need more Statistics and domain expertise, and former management/technical consultants likely need more Statistics.\nIt can also serve as a check for inclusiveness. For example, a team of former machine learning engineers is struggling to deliver meaningful projects because they lack domain expertise. However, they can’t hire domain experts because the domain experts keep failing the machine learning interviews. Comically, the machine learning engineers think that domain expertise “is easy”.\n\n\n\nEverything you don’t know is easy\n\n\nThe most useful part of Conway’s diagram for me is that I’ve time and again observed projects that don’t have representatives that can communicate well with each other in all three areas to fail. Conway’s diagram even makes it easy to show how the project failed (“nobody with domain expertise”, “missing knowledge of statistics”). Having a single person that can do all three is difficult, but it certainly solves the communication problem. That being hard or impossible, having specialists that can communicate with each other will usually be sufficient."

In my experience, one of the things that I usually miss is “intensity”. Someone that knows how to write a “Hello World!”, knows how to take averages, and know how to calculate compound interest has knowledge in all three areas of the Venn diagram, but is probably not the ideal person to lead a data science project in Finance. Conway’s is best used to tell you what’s missing for career development, for a team, for a project, but it will not solve all problems.\nIt will, however, solve many problems that matter, and will provide useful information very elegantly. You can’t ask much more from a model."

    "text": "Even though I work at Microsoft and really love Windows, I’ve recently installed Arch Linux as a dual boot.\nA lot of data scientists and software developers I know prefer OS X, and Windows doesn’t get that much love. Although many people provide many reasons not to use Windows, I was always able to work around whatever those issues were. Sometimes this required Cygwin, Git Bash, and more recently, WSL (the Windows Subsystem for Linux). I can’t remember any software that I was ever unable to use in Windows: LaTeX, git, Inkscape… everything I need had a decent Windows version, even if I had to compile it from source.\nWeirdly, because I can do so much with Windows, I find that I take too many shortcuts. The most damaging shortcuts are the ones that damage reproducibility, especially when creating documentation for my projects. It’s too easy to copy and paste into PowerPoint and be done with the communications for a talk. Some of my talks, especially about my most successful product, have many similar versions with one or two slides changed. Someone asks me for a slightly shorter or slightly longer talk and I suddenly have a new file with one or two extra (or hidden) slides that I may need to maintain. It’s not lost on me that this is a lack of discipline on my part, but if you were to invite me to a brigadeiro store, it would be hypocritical of you to accuse me of having no self-control."

    "text": "Why Arch\nI first got into contact with Arch through a German friend back in 2010. When trying to install it, I quickly learned that Arch requires you to understand what you’re doing, and especially, that if you don’t understand what you’re doing, things break. Over time, I found that although some things have a steep learning curve, the return on the time investment was very positive. I also tried Ubuntu, Fedora and Red Hat, and although I could get productive more quickly, keeping them configured to my taste later was harder - when something broke it took me longer to understand what it was.\nThere are several things that still don’t work well in Linux. One of the most vexing is having a high-DPI display. It’s somewhat hard to configure it. It works well in KDE, but KDE has tearing issues. It doesn’t work too well in GNOME unless you use Wayland, which brings a host of different issues. You can make everything a lot worse by using the NVidia proprietary driver with Wayland, but it’s needed if you want to use the GPU efficiently.\nSo although I managed to configure my Arch installation to use GNOME under Wayland and use the NVidia proprietary driver, it’s very unstable. Native applications tend to run, but many applications crash in comical ways: resizing Google Chrome under Wayland is a sure way to cause a crash, for example."

Some positions are more restricted, for example, requiring a specific city.\nPeople without the basic qualifications. In many companies, positions will have both basic and preferred qualifications listed. Read them - if you meet the basic qualifications, you’re fine. If you don’t meet the basic qualifications, you’ll get “desk rejected” and won’t even be considered. The best next step is to consider other positions - this will save you (and everyone) time.\nPeople who are already in an active application process with the company (more details in the “deduplication” step below).\n\nIf the exclusions above don’t apply to you, you’re in the candidate pool and should apply to the position using the process posted by the hiring manager or recruiter.\n\nIn large companies, it’s usually better to apply rather than ask whether you should apply. Large companies have processes, and if you wait to apply until the hiring manager replies (if they ever do), you may start at a disadvantage.\n\n\n \n\nAlso, in large companies, the candidate pool also includes applicants that didn’t get selected to other positions.

    "text": "Deduplication\nOnce you apply to a position, the first group that sees your position is the recruiting team. You should not be surprised that their goal is the same as the hiring manager’s: they want to get to the “offer accepted” stage.\nThe first thing they do is to check if you’re not already in an active process with another recruiter. If you are, they’re going to let that process finish first, and you would probably be better served by waiting until that process ends before applying.\nRecruiters manage multiple positions and hundreds of candidates, and it’s hard to keep track of complex details for everyone, such as when to contact you back in case you fail one of your 20 attempts. Recruiters do an incredibly good job of keeping track of candidates, and succeed at superhuman levels, but you can help yourself by focusing on one position at a time.\nI am not sure whether applying to multiple positions in the same company simultaneously works well. One advantage is that it may get you started early - if two teams have open positions but one is very busy, the other may get started sooner. The other is that in case you fail at one process, you have a clear backup plan communicated to your recruiter through your other applications. However, there are other ways of communicating the same information, such as “just telling them”, or applying to your second choice after you fail the first.\nThere are also downsides of multiple applications in the same company: I have seen hiring managers (not necessarily from the companies I worked at) complaining to me about candidates with many applications: “they don’t know what they want or what they’re good at”. Another downside is that your first process can be one that you’re particularly poorly-suited to. You can fail so bad that you actually don’t qualify to apply for any positions for a period of time.\nIn summary, I would personally suggest that you don’t apply to multiple positions in the same company at the same time, unless you really know what you’re doing.\nIf you are not applying to multiple positions and you have not recently been rejected, we move to the next step."

If it does, the recruiter will likely also “stack rank” your CV against the CVs of other candidates that are already in the process. Remember, the goal is to get a candidate to “offer accepted”.\nFor example, if you have a really strong CV that exceeds all the basic and preferred qualifications and is also better than all other candidates at this point, you’ll likely move to the phone screen phase right away. On the other hand, if there is already a large number of candidates in further stages and your CV barely meets the basic qualifications, you’ll probably sit in a queue for a while.\n\nIf you ask for the hiring manager to review your CV and wait for their response before applying, you may be losing valuable time.\n\n\n \n\nIn large companies, there’s no way for the hiring manager to know how your CV stacks compared to all the other applicants, as many applicants are people who didn’t get selected for other positions (those are sometimes called “recycled applications”), or people who applied through channels other than LinkedIn. These are initially seen only by the recruiters.\nWhen you ask for the hiring manager to review your CV, they usually cannot do a better job than the recruiter would have done. It’s better to apply to the position and get to the recruiter faster. This may be different if you actually know the hiring manager (e.g., you worked together). In this case, it can work to your benefit to let the hiring manager know that you’re applying, but I would still apply first and let them know afterwards.\nIn most companies, the recruiter and hiring manager can see the results of your past applications and details about your past phone screens and on-site interviews at this point. It’s best to be truthful."

    "text": "Technical Phone Screen\nIf you got here, you’ve got pretty far.\nIn many large companies, the recruiter will offer you some coaching on how to succeed at this stage. Don’t be shy about asking for help at this point. You will also find a lot of resources online to interview. For Amazon, it’s important to know the Leadership Principles. You should also check other sites for interview tips, such as Glassdoor and Blind.\nIn behavioral questions, it’s useful to structure your answer in a way that gives a lot of information to the interviewer in a short amount of time. Amazon prefers a method called STAR, which is described in this web page. I find that method to be useful to when interviewing for other companies as well.\nIf you’re interviewing for a technical position, besides a behavioral question, at this point you will be asked to solve a technical problem. In most cases, this will usually be something equivalent to a Leetcode “hard easy” or “easy medium”. If the position that you’re interviewing for is a senior position, the question may be considerably harder.\nThere are a lot of books and sites talking about how to prepare for a phone screen. The most famous one is Cracking the Code Interview. You should prepare the best you can for the phone screen. You should prepare even more if you see that your phone screen is with the hiring manager.\nIt’s not hard to fail phone screens. I have failed phone screens. I have programmed in SQL for 20+ years, and I have failed SQL phone screens. In a recent phone screen, an interviewer asked about MVC models (Model-View-Controller) and the interviewee answered about NBCs (Naive Bayes’ Classifiers) because the sound quality of the call was not so good. That could have been a disaster, but both interviewer and interviewee realized that something was wrong and recovered.\nIn most processes, the phone screen is pass/recycle/fail, instead of just pass/fail. If you don’t pass but you got close, you may get recycled to the “CV Review” phase of a similar position. When hiring managers are hiring for multiple positions (for example, SDE I and SDE II), if you fail the “higher” phone screen (e.g., SDE II) you can still be recycled for the “lower” (e.g. SDE I) phone screen and proceed to the next phase.\nFinally, hiring managers band together, because hiring managers need a lot of experienced interviewers for the on-site interview. If you barely fail a phone screen with one hiring manager but would have passed the phone screen for a different position with with another hiring manager (that would mean a different position or a lower level position), it’s possible that he will refer you to another hiring manager."

These are likely the people that will work with you day in and day out.\nMost technical interview loops are a combination of behavioral and technical interviews. The balance may vary substantially. You should be prepared for at least 40% of technical interviews, although it could be as much as 80%. The remainder will be about behavioral questions. Remember to follow the STAR method to answer questions. This will serve you well even if you’re not interviewing for Amazon.\nIt is extremely rare for a candidate to ace all interviews in a loop. Don’t be discouraged if you gave less than perfect answers a couple times. The outcome will be decided based on the opinions of all interviewers. In my (long) career, I’ve seen many loops in which the decision to hire was not unanimous and even some cases when the opinion was far from unanimous and the person still got hired and did well. Usually, the opinion of the most senior person in the loop weighs more.\nOffer If you got here, congratulations. We think you’re a good fit and want you to be a bigger part of our lives!\nMost companies have somewhat strict offer ranges for their positions and levels. That’s less true about very high levels (ranges tend to be broad), but very common for lower levels (ranges tend to be narrow). The vast majority of offers will start in the midpoint of that strict range.\nCompanies want to make an offer that a candidate will accept, because they want a candidate they liked to start sooner rather than later. I have heard about “low ball” offers inviting negotiation (especially on Blind), but I have never personally seen one.\nThat doesn’t mean you shouldn’t negotiate. If you don’t like the offer, you should certainly negotiate. If you don’t like the offer even after the negotiation, it’s time to decline and walk away. I have done this several times in my life and even regretted a few, but in general, it’s for the best.\nThat also doesn’t mean that you should always negotiate. Companies want you to accept offers and be happy you did, so it’s not uncommon for the first offer to be really good. If you are already happy, there’s some risk in negotiating. It’s important to be careful to not be final when negotiating, especially for small amounts. You don’t want to risk painting yourself in a corner for a very small potential gain.\nFor example, if you currently have a total compensation of $160k and are offered $199k (which you secretly love), it would be unproductive to go to a position of “it’s either $203k or I walk away”. That small difference may put you out of the range (e.g., the range may be 160k-200k), and even if you receive a counter of $200k (the maximum that can be offered for that position) you may feel like you have to walk away because your demands have not been met. When walking into a negotiation, know what you want, be firm but flexible. And if you love the first offer, take it. Remember that every week you delay your start can cost you approximately 2% of your first year’s salary: a year has 52 weeks."

The “to solve Y” part is frequently omitted, wasting time for everyone.\nLet me do an example to illustrate the problem. Jay is a new hire, recently hired from a prestigious school, to be the data analyst for a Finance team in a big tech company. The fiscal year is ending, and the company’s accountant asks Jay for a report that aggregates tax expenses by country. Jay recently used pandas in Jupyter for a different project, and the graphs that the accountant wants are similar to what Jay just did. Jay decides to ask “How can I connect a Jupyter notebook to the corporate database?”, so that Jay can use pandas to do fulfill the accountant’s request. When asking for help, Jay didn’t state why they want to connect their Jupyter notebook to the corporate database\nWhat Jay doesn’t know (and the accountant also doesn’t know) is that a Power BI report that does what the accountant needs already exists, and everybody in Finance has access to it.\nPeople spend time helping Jay connect to the corporate database. Jay spends time getting permissions, installing and configuring packages, etc. to solve a problem that was already solved. All this time is invested in something that is unnecessary, instead of being invested in improving the onboarding experience and documentation so that Jay and the accountant could learn that the report they needed already existed.\nDon’t be like Jay! State the problem you’re trying to solve, rather than asking for help with a specific task. You may learn a lot more.\nI love shortcuts such as “the XY problem” to explain complex concepts. I have a list in my blog."

When I do, it’s because my conscious mind reminded me that I’m not making eye contact and pushed me to do it. It takes effort and concentration. That doesn’t help me as an interviewee. When I’m an interviewer, I tell people that I like taking copious notes (because it’s true) and this usually sets them at ease with my lack of eye contact.\nI also suffer from “meeting recovery syndrome”, a concept I learned about in the book “The Surprising Science of Meetings”. After meeting people, especially a large group, I need some time alone to recover, usually by being alone for at least 15 minutes.\nBy knowing these things about myself, I can plan around them better. For example, I book time to work on an individual project (e.g., writing a promotion document) after a large meeting, and book breaks after small meetings.

Your colleagues or your manager can tell you what it takes to get promoted. Getting promoted is a good thing: it will give you a better salary and sometimes an expanded scope that will allow you to have opportunities to grow even further.\nI had many career conversations in my tenure, and in a large proportion of cases, “getting promoted on the job I currently hold” is not a typical lifelong objective, but it’s typically an objective that people have a plan for. On the other hand, people frequently tell me about major goals/objectives (change professions, open their own company, get a Ph.D., etc.) for which they don’t have an action plan.\nIt’s like their algorithm is stuck near a local maxima (in this text, optimizing will mean maximizing) and the only thing they can see is the short-term objective, so they can only trace paths to get to the local maxima.\n\nEventually, people reach a local maxima and realize it’s not their global objective. They may not know what their global objective is, they just know “it’s not this”. Interestingly, the way that people solve that problem is not that different from what an algorithm would do if it realized it got stuck in a local maxima: take a big step, and start again from someplace else."

    "text": "THe multi-armed bandit\nThe hardest problem to solve in career optimization is lack of information. People may have some general idea of where they want to go, but usually not much. For example, I commonly hear people saying that they want to become managers, but after just a few questions I realize that they don’t really know what that means and whether they actually want that.\nOne way to maximize happiness under incomplete information is to explore several different things, and once you find what makes you happy, then you exploit it (although “exploit” is a somewhat aggressive word in English, it’s actually the technical term), getting as much happiness as you can from it. There are algorithms to find a good balance between exploration and exploitation. One example is the “multi-armed bandit”.\nThe concept comes from slot machines in casinos. Because a slot machine has one lever that people pull to activate it and people usually lose money on it, it’s called an “one-armed bandit”.\nImagine a slot machine that has multiple levers, therefore a “multi-armed bandit”. When pulled, each lever gives a prize based on a statistical distribution that is unknown to the player. You pull the first lever and get $100. Should you pull the same lever again or switch? Maybe one of the other levers has a constant payoff of $1,000. Maybe that lever you just pulled is actually the best one.\nWithout knowing the distributions, you can’t know the optimal action to take. In real life, not only one doesn’t know the distributions, but the distributions for each lever can change over time. If that was not complicated enough, you also have infinite levers to choose from. Nobody said it was supposed to be easy.\n\nThe multi-armed bandit problem doesn’t have a general optimal solution, but has several strategies that achieve approximate solutions. It is a classical reinforcement learning problem.\nMany strategies are very simple “epsilon” strategies, for which one decides a proportion epsilon (between 0 and 1) of exploration (trying to figure out the distributions of the available actions), and the remainder of the time is used for exploitation (performing the action that is expected to yield the best results).\nIn career conversations, I always suggest that people take the time to explore new things, especially things that are in the (conceptual) neighborhood of what they think they want. Because I’m older than the average tech person, they may think this is some form of ancient wisdom, but I’m just pointing them towards a classical (and somewhat modern) reinforcement learning algorithm.\nThat’s using data science in production."

Back then, I didn’t know about the #pomodoro method, which can actually be used in a similar way.\nAfter that, the “dwell time” of tasks that annoyed me dropped sharply: once I booked the time, the task was mostly out of my mind.

    "text": "Gather close as I tell you a cautionary tale about data science.\nA new data scientist had just started working on the collections team for a large company. One of the problems they wanted to solve was “does contacting customers help at all?”\nIt’s an important question. After all, the cost of collections is directly related to the number of contacts. The more contacts, the more people.\nThe DS had a table with of invoices and payment dates, and a table with a history of contacts by invoice. Using the invoice issue date and invoice payment date, he created a payment delay metric. Then, he joined the contact history and created a metric for number of contacts. Finally, he calculated the correlation between the number of contacts and payment delay.\nHe was startled by the results: the more contacts per invoice, the longer it took customers to pay.\nHe told the collections manager, who got very excited. He long suspected that the contact center had too many people. Now he had some proof.\nThe DS carefully separated the data in a training and a test sample, and trained a regression model using XGBoost. Given inputs such as the invoice country and amount, the model predicted the delay in days given an estimated number of contacts. The model had a very low error (&lt;0.5d) in the training dataset. When using the unseen test dataset, the error was also minimal.\nThe DS and the collections manager made a plan to deploy a tool to collectors. When assigned an invoice, collectors should enter the characteristics of the invoice in the tool and add 1 contact. For example, if a collector was assigned an invoice with 10 days delay and 2 contacts, they should enter 3 as the number of contacts. If the model returned a number larger than the current delay, the collector should not make the contact. They should just wait.\nOnce the tool was deployed, the number of contacts initially dropped a lot. To the collections manager surprise, however, the payment delays also increased. Customers were paying much later than usual, and ended up having to be contacted anyway.\nAs you may already have realized, the problem with the idea was that customers were not delaying because they were annoyed with too many contacts. The relation went in the other direction: customers were being contacted because they were late. While contacts and lateness was very correlated, lateness caused contacts, not the other way around.\nThe project was scrapped. The team decided that data science was all hype. The data scientist moved on to another team. The collections team went back to the old way of contacting customers: about once per week until they paid.\nIt took a while (and a new data scientist) for that team to trust data science again: a few years later, a new data scientist started experimenting with assigning different strategies to randomized customers, and that improved collections a lot. But that’s another tale."

Of course, measuring things is tricky, and an art that we #DataScientists are (or at least should be) very familiar with. Measuring things differently, Seattle has around 150 “sunny days” per year, and Miami has around 250. That’s almost three months less.\nMeasuring things in yet another way, the average number of hours of sunlight in Seattle per year is approximately 2,000. Miami and LA get approximately 3,200. Las Vegas gets 3,800. Besides being cloudy and rainy, Seattle is further to the north, and the sun sets before 5 PM for a large part of the winter.\nI find that the lack of sunlight gets to me a lot more than the rain and the temperature, both of which I actually enjoy.\nOne trick I learned is to use “corn cob lightbulbs” everywhere in my house. A 50W corn cob bulb produces 5,000 lumens. A typical 13W CFL light produces about 1,000 lumens, the same as a 60W incandescent light. After installing corn cob lightbulbs in my office, I started feeling a lot less tired after a long day of #wfh during the winter, even finding energy to cook and play board games with my kids.\nIf you’re considering to move to Seattle, it’s not about the umbrellas. It rarely rains hard enough to justify using one. It’s more about finding a way of being outside when there’s sunlight (and there are plenty of great things to do around Seattle what that’s the case) and getting enough illumination when one can’t go out."

Having been into both Microsoft and FAANG and having participated on hundreds of recruiting processes for both (as an interviewer, hiring manager and interviewee), I have #feelings about this. Lots of feelings.\nFirst off, let’s get my economist way of thinking and potential biases out of the way. By revealed preference, you know I prefer Microsoft to FAANG, at least under the conditions that were offered to me. I recently chose to come back to work for Microsoft from FAANG (I also had recent offers from other FAANGs). Therefore, take my words with a grain of salt.\nAlso, given recent performance, FAANGs are not an investment thing anymore. For pop-investing fans, the acronym is now MAMAA, one of which is Microsoft (Netflix was dropped).\nBut this doesn’t matter, since the main argument about FAANGs was about recruiting: FAANGs (allegedly) pay better than Microsoft. There are non-FAANG companies that also (at least used to) pay extremely well (e.g., Airbnb and Uber). When recruiters compete against FAANGs, it’s a difficult fight. It’s not uncommon to have a FAANG offer that is 50% over other companies. You don’t have to spend a lot of time in Blind to find out that in terms of total compensation, FAANGs pay very well.\nI can tell you: it’s great to be paid very well. I can also tell you: it’s not the only thing that matters.\nAs a data scientist, I think a lot about optimization problems. If your personal career optimization problem is solving for maximizing short-term total compensation (TC), FAANGs are great. And, as that same recruiter wrote in a subsequent post, there’s no shame on having that goal.\nBut maybe you want to optimize for other things: work/life balance, impact, stress, learning, risk, work environment. Short-term TC is super important, especially in when you want to get a house, buy a car, get established, pay those student loans. But after some point, it may matter less to you. Privilege check: this is about choosing between high degrees of privilege, and I’m blessed and humbled to have the opportunity to choose, as many in the tech area do.\nFor the opportunities that were available to me, Microsoft was by far the best option for what I was optimizing for: learning, working with people I admire, work life balance, being able to talk about my work, having lasting impact on the world, and very good compensation with lower stock market risk.\nAs any person that knows about Goodhart’s Law or Charlie Munger can tell you, you get what you optimize for. When you’re choosing what you are optimizing for, make sure that it is what you really want."

    "text": "One of the worst things I have done as a manager was to go to a meeting. Luckily, I had a friend on that meeting (also a manager) that taught me something really important.\nHere’s what I did wrong.\nThere was this meeting between several data science teams. It was really hard to find a time that worked for everybody. The meeting ended up being scheduled on a Friday morning, at about 9 AM on the day I was going on vacations. I couldn’t go, so I gave the meeting to one of my directs and we planned it out together. Some of the other teams had prep meetings, of which both me and my direct could (and did) participate. I couldn’t be on the big meeting to align on the roadmap, but it was well-supported and felt like everything was under control. Other members of my team would also attend to provide details about their projects, and they were well-prepared.\nOn the day of the meeting, which was also the first day of my long-awaited vacations, I was packed and ready to leave for my trip when I got a notice that my flight was delayed. I was planning to leave home a little after 9 AM, but now I could safely leave 10:30 AM and still arrive comfortably at the airport. Staying home longer would even mean less traffic to the airport.\nWith time to spare, I decided to join the meeting, even though I was a little late. When I joined, the meeting stopped, and people said something to the effect of “Oh, Lucas, I thought you were on vacation and were not going to join”, to which I responded: “I’m on vacations, but my flight was delayed. Since I could join and didn’t want to miss the meeting, I joined”.\nSurprisingly directly and publicly, my friend on the meeting said: “Nah, you should log off. Otherwise, you’re going to start giving my team and your team the impression that they should join meetings during their vacations if they can, and that’s not setting a good example for work life balance”. (This was at Amazon, by the way).\nI flushed for 10 seconds (it was an audio call only, thankfully) but realized she was completely right. I was a little embarrassed for being called out in public, but I’m usually not embarrassed for being wrong, at least not for long. I said: “You’re right, sorry for the disruption, I’m the least prepared for this meeting since I wasn’t planning to attend, and I’m sure I’ll be updated when I get back, I’ll drop off now”, got a bunch of “Have a good vacation” and disconnected.\nIn addition to showing that “vacations are important”, I also had the opportunity to show that “being wrong is ok”. Nobody was shutting me out. When I came back, I took over that workstream and ran it to the end. I was just making it harder for my team to help me by showing that I could help myself. Besides, we were just being fiercely protective of the work/life balance that we worked so hard to achieve on that group.\nI didn’t realize the message I was sending, and I was glad to be called out."

The package was a little unwieldy: the food comes as a paste in sealed plastic bag. I needed to use scissors to cut the top of the package and press out the paste into the bowl. It is hard to measure the exact quantity, and easy to get one’s hand dirty, which makes it harder to convince my kids to do it. Measuring the right amount is also tricky.\nThe food needs to be frozen, defrosted and kept refrigerated. That makes it inconvenient to use it in travel.\nDid I hate it?

Being a careful scientist, I thought this could be because she was hungry due to the lower calories, but I tested that she devours the food even after getting a lot of calories from other foods in prior meals. She really likes the food. I think it’s a staple of VC investments that they want to sell solutions rather than products, and this solved my main problem.\nThe downside: I had to adjust the calorie count up, which meant that the Farmer’s Dog is now more expensive than my previous food."

There’s usually a reason why the problem is still unsolved. The worst type of reason is when the interviewers are incapable of solving the problems themselves. In that case, it’s possible that the candidate will give the right answer and the interviewers won’t recognize it. That’s not very common, but I’ve seen it happen. The candidate is lucky if they don’t get the job.\nSome slightly better scenarios are when the interviewer could know the answer, but they don’t because answering that question hasn’t been a priority. In these cases, data is usually bad and/or the question is not well-defined. All those cases are clearly problematic for the candidate to solve under the pressure they face in the interview."

That’s also hard to pull off - the candidate is nervous, and the interviewer has the “curse of knowledge” - questions that are obvious to the interviewer may not be obvious to the candidate.\nEven if the interviewer is skilled and experienced enough to pull off something like that, the high-pressure setting of the interview also presents a problem for dealing with ambiguity. Time is ticking. It’s understandable that candidates will sometimes apply for jobs that require solving ambiguous problems under pressure, but those situations are usually different from interviews. When a person gets into a high-pressure situation at work, they usually have a lot of context and at least some preparation. Unless the candidate is aware beforehand that they will get this type of question, this is likely to work out poorly."

    "text": "If you’re a data scientist, you’re probably very much used to wait for model training results.\nSometimes I wait for so long that I forget to check back. To help me with that, I wrote a tiny script that uses Twilio to text me when my model is done training.\nTwilio is inexpensive. At the time I’m writing this, it costs $1 per month for a phone number. You can also use your own phone number for 50 cents per month, but I didn’t try that yet. Each text costs less than 1 cent. Even in a month when I am getting lots of notifications, I usually spend less than $2.\nAfter importing the library, the code to send an update is an one-liner:\nclient.api.account.messages.create(to=, from_=, body=“Training done!”)\nHere’s a simple example of how this already saved me time. During the development of a model, I frequently do something like a LIMIT(1000) in my data to make sure the whole program (inputs, outputs, diagnostics) is working before running the model on the full data. I thought I was ready to go and kicked off the model, closed my computer and was going out for the day, without knowing that I had forgotten to remove the LIMIT(1000). Almost immediately, I got a text telling me that training was complete. I logged back in, removed the LIMIT(1000) from the data acquisition, and kicked off the training again.\nIf I didn’t receive the text, I would realize what happened only on the day after, and would have to wait for the model to run instead of simply starting my next day analyzing the results.\nThat’s pretty good value for one line."

If the screener is too lenient, lots of people will pass the phone screen but fail the on-site interview. The opposite is not necessarily a good sign. If the pass rate on the phone screen is low but the pass rate on the on-site interview is high, it could mean that the screener is too strict, but it could also mean that the candidate pool is bad.\nTech screeners should usually be more experienced than the average interviewer.

You may think that the fraudsters that use such emails are lazy or uneducated, and that the emails have errors because the fraudsters are not good at English. The truth is a lot more fun.\nWe start by assuming that the “fraudster”/“bad actor” is a profit maximizer, and that their cost per hour is $10. Let’s assume it costs $50 to create an email with errors, and $200 to craft an error-free email. They pay this cost only once.\nLet’s also assume that they can send that email for free to 1 million people, of which 10% (100,000) are “gullible” (easy to trick), and the remaining 900,000 are “skeptical” (hard to trick). When a potential victim responds, the bad actor has to invest some time with them to get their financial information. If they’re gullible, the bad actor has to invest 5 hours ($50) on average, and they get $1,000. If they’re skeptical, the bad actor will invest 10 hours on average to realize that they’re skeptical, and will get no financial information (profit = $0).\nThe email with errors gets a 2 out of 10 response from gullible people and no response from skeptical people. If the bad actor uses this email, the victim pool will have 20,000 gullible people. The well-crafted email gets a 8 out of 10 response from gullible people and a 1 out of 9 response from skeptical people. In this case, the victim pool will have 80,000 gullible and 90,000 skeptical people.\nAfter sending the e-mail, the bad actor has a 1,000-hour budget (that’s about 6 months of work) to work with the pool of respondents. When they choose a new potential victim from the pool of respondents, assume the draw is uniformly distributed over the proportions of the pool. That is, for the error-free email, they get a gullible person with probability 8/17 and a skeptical with probability 9/17. For the email with errors, it’s always a gullible person.\nWhich of the two emails should the bad actor send in order to maximize their profits?\nFollow-up: should the bad actor invest in an even better email that everyone (gullible and skeptical) responds to?\nIf you work through the example, you’ll find that the email with errors performs better, because it filters out time-wasting smart people. Real scammers use bad emails on purpose: only the very gullible will respond, making the scammer job easier."

This ACM survey paper (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3395046) gives a good idea about the state of the art around 2020. It is far from a solved problem.\nAs you would expect, computer scientists break difficult problems into parts, and even the subtasks for fake news detection are hard. A few examples of subtasks are detecting if the headline matches the content of the news, evaluating the reputation of who is sharing the news, evaluating the reputation of the news website, etc.\nFor this latter task, a product I have found to be useful is NewsGuard https://www.newsguardtech.com/. Although NewsGuard has been (in my opinion, fairly) criticized a few years ago for having a bias towards the left, it has been improving continuously. These days, I find it very helpful, especially since I study disinformation and fraud for a living, and therefore my browsing patterns are… atypical.\nIt helps that NewsGuard is free for users of Microsoft Edge. You can install a NewsGuard extension and it will show whether the site you are seeing is trustworthy. It will also integrate with Bing when used in Edge, and show a badge next to each result.\nIf you want to try it out, the following link has the instructions: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/newsguard-b28e453e-568c-4d57-98ef-c61056f99462.

This whole gear system is stuck: if someone tries to introduce any movement, the system works to stay firmly locked into place.\nI’m still trying to decide if this is a mistake.

    "text": "Step 3: Generate Images\nNow you are ready to generate images with Stable Diffusion. You just need to provide a text prompt as input. For example, the following code will generate an image of a “jedi schnauzer”:\nprompt = \"jedi schnauzer\"\nimage = pipeline(prompt=prompt, height=512, width=512, num_inference_steps=80, guidance_scale=7.5).images[0]\nThe pipeline method will return an image object that you can display or save as you wish. You can also customize some parameters of the generation process, such as the number of samples, the resolution, and the number of diffusion steps.

    "text": "In 2018, Google announced its artificial intelligence (AI) system called Google Duplex, which was designed to make phone calls on behalf of users for tasks such as booking haircut appointments or making restaurant reservations. The technology sparked both excitement and concern, as people worried about the potential implications of AI taking over jobs and being used for social engineering purposes.\n\n\n\nAs with many new technologies, the initial hype surrounding Google Duplex has given way to a more nuanced understanding of its capabilities and limitations. One user review revealed that the actual experience of using Duplex was less than ideal, as it took longer to set up the AI system to make a call than it would have taken to simply make the call themselves. Google later admitted that at least 25% of calls made by Duplex failed and required human intervention, highlighting the limitations of the technology. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced the need for booking services. Dropping my kid at a high school in 2022 quickly confirmed to me that haircuts were not a priority.\n\n\n\nGoogle Duplex has since been integrated into Pixel smartphones and the Google Assistant, allowing users to access the AI system more easily. However, user reviews on platforms like Reddit have been mixed, with many expressing the sentiment that Duplex is “great when it works.” A few people have mentioned that they have had success using Duplex to make restaurant reservations, but not all restaurants accept it.\n\n\n\nWhen Duplex was demonstrated by Google’s CEO in 2018, it seemed ready to take over the world. It’s a good reminder that demonstrations are usually very scripted and tested, and that may give the impression that things work a lot better than they would work in the real world.\nThis is also a good reminder to take a lot of what you see about Large Language Models with a grain of salt. LLMs can do amazing things, but they are not perfect, and in many cases, they are still very imperfect. Emerging technologies like chaining and goal-seeking could significantly improve the capabilities of systems based in language models, allowing them to better understand and improve automatically, but most products I see on my day-to-day are just thin wrappers on top of an existing model like ChatGPT, with minimal engineering. I don’t think GPT is going to kill engineering. I’m entirely on the opposite side of the spectrum: I think it’s going to make engineering more important than ever. Somebody will need to integrate and monitor these models and their applications, and that’s not going to be a trivial task.\n\n\n\nIf you see the pace of AI technology releases releases and you get caught up in the hype, you may be worried like the people were worried about Duplex in 2018. Take your time to learn about new technologies. Be intentional: it’s definitely worthwhile understanding what LLMs are and are their advantages and limitations, but not necessarily optimal worrying about every new application, like AutoGPT. Remember the Vicki Boykis rule: whatever is important will be here six months from now, a lot will not."

Since presumably I could pass the test and get in, I got that idea drilled into me from a young age. I was going to be a doctor.\nIn a comic twist of fate, people in my family started fighting over an inheritance that was not very big (maybe equivalent to $100k USD today). People started getting divorced. They needed lawyers. The campaign to make me a lawyer started.\nUltimately, when I was 17, I needed to decide what career to pursue. I actually applied for Law, Medicine, and Engineering in the three top universities from my state. Maybe fate would decide where I was going to go. Fate had other plans: I got into all three.

Not only did I love it, but I did super well. I quit Law school, did the standardized tests again, and got into Computer Science.\nI kept having the same problems I have always had as a student: in Computer Science, I was interested in databases, graph theory, and statistics, but not in compilers or linear algebra.

Also, I started to really like Finance: I was good at it. I went back to school to learn more Finance and get really, really good at it. At some point, I started thinking that going back into a software engineering position would not make me happy: I would have to go back a lot in my career to start again.\nI lucked out. Suddenly, there was this new thing called Data Science that required technical skills, statistics, and expertise in a subject-matter.

One day, I was in my kitchen talking to my sister-in-law, who works in Finance and had only known me as somebody who worked in Finance. At some point, she called me “a tech person”.

I ended up doing a lot of fun Data Science projects that I’m very proud of.\nAt this point in my career, I hired a career coach. I wish I had done that a lot sooner.

Knowing a little bit more about the impact I wanted to have in the world while still providing for the needs of my family helped me think about what I would love to have in a position.
