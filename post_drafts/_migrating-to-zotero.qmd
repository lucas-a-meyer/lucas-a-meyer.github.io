I have used Mendeley for quite a long time. Recently, Mendeley has started to become less and less useful. They cancelled their iPhone and iPad apps. What other features did they lose? In the wise words of a Twitter user, I decided to jump out of this frog-boiling cauldron before it got too hot.

The iPad app feature was important to me. That's how I carried a bunch of papers around.
