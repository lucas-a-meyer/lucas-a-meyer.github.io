# Google Duplex was going to change the world five years ago

## Introduction

In 2018, Google announced its artificial intelligence (AI) system called Google Duplex, which was designed to make phone calls on behalf of users for tasks such as booking haircut appointments or making restaurant reservations. The technology sparked both excitement and concern, as people worried about the potential implications of AI taking over jobs and being used for social engineering purposes.

## The Reality of Google Duplex

As with many new technologies, the initial hype surrounding Google Duplex has given way to a more nuanced understanding of its capabilities and limitations. One user review revealed that the actual experience of using Duplex was less than ideal, as it took longer to set up the AI system to make a call than it would have taken to simply make the call oneself. Google later admitted that at least 25% of calls made by Duplex required human intervention, highlighting the limitations of the technology. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced the need for booking services. Dropping my kid at a high school in 2022 was quick to review that haircuts were not a priority.

## Duplex's Integration and Current State

Google Duplex has since been integrated into Pixel smartphones and the Google Assistant, allowing users to access the AI system more easily. However, user reviews on platforms like Reddit have been mixed, with many expressing the sentiment that Duplex is "great when it works." 

## Large Language Models and the Future of Duplex

There is still much excitement surrounding large language models and their potential to revolutionize our day-to-day. Emerging technologies like chaining and goal-seeking could significantly improve the capabilities of Duplex, allowing it to better understand and respond to user needs. However, it's important to remember that technology, especially recorded ones, will only show successful applications, and the reality of using these systems may not always live up to the hype.

## Conclusion

Instead of panicking over new technological releases and getting caught up in the hype, take your time learning about new technologies and understanding their potential impact. Remember Vicki Boykis rule: truly useful and impactful technologies will continue to be relevant in the future, whether it's six months or five years from now. As for Google Duplex, it serves as a reminder that while AI has come a long way, there is still much progress to be made before it can fully live up to its promises.
