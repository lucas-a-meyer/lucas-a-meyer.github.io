title: A model for task execution under uncertainty

A company wants to execute a series of profitable tasks. Managers receive tasks and can route these tasks to either experts or non-experts. Manages' ability determines how well they can tell experts from non-experts. Non-experts have a small chance to succeed, a chance of failure, and a small chance of catastrophic failure. Whenever non-experts succeed, managers' ability goes *down*. When non-experts fail catastrophically, managers' experience will go up. Experts can have exceptional success, sucess or failure, but they'll never fail catastrophically. When experts have exceptional success, managers will gain experience. When experts fail, managers will lose experience.  

Workers (experts and non-experts) always know their true experience level. (This is a simplification, as it might be interesting for non-experts to be overly confident). Managers ability will be a standard deviation applied to the level of expertise of their employees. Competent managers will have a low standard deviation, where incompetent ones will have high standard deviation. Underutilized experts quit, reducing the company's expert pool. Again, for simplification, experts and non-experts are paid the same (it may be interesting to reward experts and non-experts based on their perceived expertise)

This problem has been in my head for a lot longer than it should. This is a rough draft, but I think that if I do not commit it to "paper", I won't make progress on it.
