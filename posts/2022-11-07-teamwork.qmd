title: Teamwork - what's wrong with this picture?

<article data-clarity-region="article">


If your office has a "teamwork gears" picture like this one, you may be thinking about working remotely.

I'm not even talking about the guy riding the rocket. I'm going to assume that it's a crash test dummy, not an allusion to the recent acquisition of #Twitter. The problem I have is with the gears.

You see, if the person with the mustache and the red shirt turns the gear **clockwise**, this would push the other two gears to turn **counter-clockwise**. But these other two gears push each other in opposite directions. 

For example, if "red" moves clockwise, it will push "green" to move counter-clockwise, which in turn pushes "blue" to move clockwise, which in turn pushes "red" to move counter-clockwise... but "red" was being pushed to move clockwise to begin with. This whole gear system is stuck: if someone tries to introduce any movement, the system works to stay firmly locked into place.

I'm still trying to decide if this is a mistake. Maybe it's just great art, a subtle criticism about #teamwork that the artist snuck in. Maybe they worked in a #toxic workplace, or had a lot of group projects in high school.

It's in days like this that I realize how luck I've been in my career. The teams I worked in (and my current team, the AI for Good Lab) were always places that were simultaneously good at science and great places to work at. 

I hope you are as lucky as I am.
