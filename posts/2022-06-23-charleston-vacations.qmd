For my latest #vacation, I went with my family to the Charleston, SC area, more specifically to the Isle of Palms. We were very lucky to get amazing weather and see some [dolphins in the wild](2022-04-04-south-carolina-dolphins.qmd).

A few years ago, I decided to concentrate all my travel on #Hyatt and #OneWorld, and it was really worth it. My family is larger than average, and while it took me a while to "build equity" with those two brands, I am now enjoying a lot of useful perks (selecting airplane seats for free, free breakfast, no resort fee, 4 pm late checkouts). 

Charleston has a lively downtown, and several historical tourist attractions. Whenever we travel, we always like checking out the Mediterranean food options. We loved Layla for Lebanese food, and Stella's for Greek food. We also went to Swig and Swine for barbecue, although we preferred The Home Team on Sullivan Island.

We stayed at the [Wild Dunes Resort Residences at Sweetgrass](https://www.destinationhotels.com/wild-dunes), which was surprisingly affordable (we booked our stay several months in advance). The best surprise was having a washer and dryer in our room, which was helpful given how often the kids went to the pool. The resort is opening several restaurants and shops (a few even opened when we were there) so we think it won't be affordable for long.
