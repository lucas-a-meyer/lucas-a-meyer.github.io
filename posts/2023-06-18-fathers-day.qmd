I didn't have a good father. But my mother showed up. Happy Father's Day to all fathers that show up, and to all non-dads and single moms that do so much every day to fill in that giant void.

We are different in social media than we are in real life. The most important thing I am is a father, but I avoid talking about my family on social media. 

I'll make a small exception today to share the "All About My Dad" worksheet my kids filled for me:

Dad's favorite thing to do: spend time with us
Dad's favorite food: eggs benedict
Dad's job: data scientist that does good 
Dad is happy when: he spends time with us, gets kisses from the dog
Dad is mad when: we don't do our homework and don't ask for help
Dad is really good at: being a dad, picking up dog poop
Dad likes to say: "It's Broncos country, let's ride" (I'm a Seahawks fan)
I love my dad because: he is good at math, he is caring and loving, he's funny
My dad loves me because: I'm the best (older, middle, youngest) child

I'm very lucky, and I hope you are too. It goes faster than it seems.
