# Large Language Models: A Fresh Start for Your Career

Imagine your career as a vast ocean, and you're a surfer waiting for the perfect wave to ride. Large language models can be that wave, offering you a fresh start and a chance to make a splash in the world of analytics. Just like the first light of dawn that brings new opportunities, large language models can be the catalyst for change in your professional life.

If you're a fan of behavioral economics, you might be familiar with the "fresh start effect." This phenomenon refers to the tendency of people to take action towards a goal after a temporal landmark that signifies a new beginning. Katy Milkman, a renowned expert in this field, has extensively studied and written about the fresh start effect. Some examples of fresh starts include the beginning of a new year, the start of a new job, or even moving to a new city.

Perhaps you've been trying to break into the world of analytics for some time now but missed out on earlier opportunities. You might have overlooked Andrew Ng's course, Hadoop, Kaggle, or even running classification models on the Titanic and clustering or classification models on irises. But don't worry, it's never too late to catch a new wave.

Many professionals in the field today joined during one of these waves. They started riding the wave, learning new things, and sharing their knowledge through discussions and blog posts. Eventually, some people moved on, while others stayed and formed relationships, meeting again on the next wave.

Now, it's your turn. Large language models are new territory for many people, even those who have been around for a while. There are numerous opportunities to contribute, learn, and grow in this exciting field. Like a gardener planting seeds in fertile soil, you can sow the seeds of your future success by embracing large language models.

So, don't hesitate to dive into this new world. Start exploring large language models, engage with the community, and share your insights. As you ride this wave, you'll not only learn and grow professionally, but you'll also form lasting connections with others in the field. And who knows, this fresh start might just be the beginning of a thrilling and fulfilling journey in the world of analytics.
