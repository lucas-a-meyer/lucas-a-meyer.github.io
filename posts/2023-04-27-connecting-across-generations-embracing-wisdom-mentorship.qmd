Aging isn't always a walk in the park, but one silver (heh) lining is the wisdom gained from experience and the opportunity to share it with the younger generation. As time marches on, I find myself connecting with the college-bound and fresh-out-of-college kids of my longtime friends on LinkedIn.

Navigating the complexities of getting older can be a challenge, but there's something undeniably rewarding about witnessing the next generation embark on their own journeys. It's like watching a new chapter unfold in a captivating novel.

These connections often lead to engaging conversations, where we exchange stories and insights. It's a unique form of reverse mentorship: I share my "old man" tales, while they keep me in the loop on the latest trends. Thanks to them, I now know that dabbing and using "sus" are no longer in vogue.

As the years continue to pass, I look forward to maintaining these connections and expanding my network to include the grandkids of my friends. It's a delightful reminder that, despite the challenges of aging, there's always something to learn and share with the generations that follow. So, here's to embracing the wisdom that comes with age and fostering meaningful connections across the years.
