During a couple of our conference calls, I told my team that I needed a moment because I needed to deal with a bear situation. Usually it was quick, just the dog barking a lot, or an overturned trash can. I’m not sure they believed me.

Today I was able to get good pictures of a young black bear that climbed a tree some 30 feet behind my backyard.

It’s truly special to live so close to nature and I really hope we’re not bothering the bears too much.
