title: Discover the Best Spy Novelist of Our Time with Mick Herron's Slow Horses

---

Are you a fan of spy novels and TV shows? If so, you need to check out Mick Herron's Slow Horses series, which has been hailed as a masterpiece by critics and fans alike. In fact, Herron is now being heralded as the best spy novel writer of our generation.

The Slow Horses series has also been adapted into a TV show on Apple TV+, with Gary Oldman playing the main character, Jackson Lamb. Lamb is a unique character, and has quickly become one of my favorites of all time, knocking off Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation.

Lamb is very direct and competent, but he manages the worst spies in the service. He doesn't hold back on how bad his spies are, which makes for a refreshing and entertaining read (or watch).

The book series has 8 novels and 4 novellas, but it struggled for a while, even being dropped because of low sales. However, the series has gained a following in recent years, and for good reason. The books are phenomenal, but the TV series is even better. The TV series expands on the books, which are a little on the short side.

One thing to note, however, is that if you are a manager, you shouldn't follow Jackson Lamb's management style. While he may be effective in managing his spies, his methods are not suitable for a real-life workplace.

Overall, if you're looking for a thrilling and entertaining spy series, look no further than Mick Herron's Slow Horses. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
