Have you heard of the Slow Horses series by Mick Herron? If not, you're missing out on one of the best spy novel series of our generation. Herron's writing is so compelling that it has been adapted into a masterpiece TV series on Apple TV+.

The main character of the series, Jackson Lamb, is played by the legendary Gary Oldman. Lamb is my favorite character of all time, knocking off even Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation. He is direct and competent, but manages the worst spies in the service. He doesn't hold back on how bad his spies are, making for a refreshing and honest portrayal of the world of espionage.

The book series has 8 novels and 4 novellas, but it struggled for a while, even being dropped because of low sales. However, the series is a phenomenal read, and the TV adaptation is even better. The books are a little on the short side, but the TV series expands on them, making for a more immersive experience.

While Lamb is an excellent character, it's important to note that if you're a manager, you shouldn't follow his management style. His tactics may be effective in the world of espionage, but they won't work in a traditional workplace setting.

Overall, the Slow Horses series is a must-read for anyone who loves spy novels or just enjoys compelling storytelling. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed.
