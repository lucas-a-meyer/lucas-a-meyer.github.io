I’m extremely happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Principal Data Scientist at the AI for Good Research Lab at Microsoft!

This is an amazing team led by Juan M. Lavista Ferres, and I frequently still pinch myself to make sure it's not just a dream, but instead, that it's a dream come true.

My family is also super happy: my kids and even my mom wore #Microsoft shirts the whole weekend in support.

I bring the mug pictured below that I got two decades (!) ago when I first joined Microsoft in 2002. I will also bring all that I learned as a student and mentor at the University of Washington - Michael G. Foster School of Business.

I also want to thank Katie Baird, PCC for her incredible support in helping me find clarity in my career, and Jennifer Fink for introducing me to Katie.

Finally, I want to thank *you*, yes, you, who interacted with me and the content I put out here on LinkedIn.

I learn a lot from #writing, and from interacting with you. Thanks for making writing worthwhile, and I hope my content is helpful to you in some way.

It's an exciting and energizing new beginning, and there's a lot of people and organizations to empower to achieve more.
