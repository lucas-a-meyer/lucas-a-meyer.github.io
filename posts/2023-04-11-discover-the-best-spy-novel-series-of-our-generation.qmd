Attention all book lovers and spy novel enthusiasts! Have you heard of Mick Herron and his Slow Horses series? If not, you're missing out on what is being hailed as the best spy novel series of our generation.

The Slow Horses series has even been adapted into a masterpiece TV series on Apple TV+, with Gary Oldman playing the main character of the series, Jackson Lamb. And let me tell you, Lamb is my favorite character of all time, knocking off Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation.

Lamb is a direct and competent leader, but what sets him apart is his ability to manage the worst spies in the service. He doesn't hold back on how bad his spies are, which makes for a refreshing and entertaining read.

The book series consists of 8 novels and 4 novellas, but it struggled for a while, even being dropped because of low sales. However, the series is truly phenomenal, and the TV adaptation is even better. The books are a little on the short side, but the TV series expands on them, making for a more immersive experience.

But a word of caution for all managers out there: you shouldn't follow Jackson Lamb's management style. While he may be effective in managing his team of misfits, his abrasive and unorthodox methods are not recommended in real-life management situations.

So, if you're looking for a thrilling and entertaining read or a new TV series to binge-watch, the Slow Horses series is definitely worth checking out. Mick Herron has truly cemented himself as a master of the spy novel genre, and Jackson Lamb is a character that you won't soon forget.
