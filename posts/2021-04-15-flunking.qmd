title: Flunking a SQL interview with 20+ years of practice

I learned SQL in college in 1997. My first professional experience was MS SQL Server 6.5 in 1998. 

I have written SQL almost daily for over 20 years. A few years ago, I flunked a SQL interview for a *manager* position. 

The problem was that it had been too many years since my last interview. I didn't know _anything_ about interviewing recently, like, for example, the remote CoderPad. Even though I was prepared for the non-technical parts of the interview, since I had not done a technical interview for long, I was nervous. Not knowing how things worked made me more nervous.

Since then, I have always volunteered to be an interviewer. I have occasionally interviewed ["just in case"](https://www.meyerperin.com/posts/2022-04-13-my-policies-around-interviewing.html). That helped, and when the [perfect job](https://www.meyerperin.com/posts/2022-04-18-joining-microsoft.html) appeared for me, I was ready.
