How much of what you do is borrowed from other people? When you realized you learned something from someone, did you tell them?

If you come from a disadvantaged background, there's a possibility that the adults around you didn't have much to teach you, or worse, taught you self-limiting behaviors. This is not always true, and many people from disadvantaged backgrounds have a lot of support from their family. However, the ones that don't may distrust learning from other people. When they find themselves in a supportive environment, that's a serious impediment.

I had to learn how to learn from other people myself. I recently realized that I haven't told these people what I learned from them. Here's my list of amazing people, and the amazing things they taught me. It's not complete yet, and it may never be.

- Michal Panowicz taught me about the importance of work skills. I am still surprised at how many people don't know those things.
    - Setting career goals
    - Naming files to avoid conflicts and confusion, naming documents, titling slides, having a sensible presentation flow
    - Writing good emails, including the appropriate people, sending them on appropriate times, ensure they have clear action items.

- Ed Rice taught me a lot of Economics, especially how to translate a real-world problem to an economic model. He also taught me how to be a better teacher. Because of him, I still start a lot of sentences with "you know..."

- Matt Fingerhut taught me a lot about how to be a manager:
    - Protecting time for email and focused work
    - Prioritizing coordination and communication - if the manager doesn't do this for the team, who would?

- Urszula Chajewska taught me that science already know the answer to a lot of questions, and how to do better literature reviews

- Jorge Pulido taught me to (very politely) learn about the incentives of people in teams I collaborate with. This helped me understand collaborators better and made my life substantially easier.

There are a ton of other people that helped me be better. Some I did not include because I still work with them. It would feel sycophantic. Some I didn't have time to organize how to write about them yet. But I'll get there!
