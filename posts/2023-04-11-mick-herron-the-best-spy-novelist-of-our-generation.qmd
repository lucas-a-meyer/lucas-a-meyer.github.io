If you're a fan of spy novels, you need to know about Mick Herron. He's being hailed as the best spy novel writer of our generation, and for good reason.

His Slow Horses series, which follows a group of disgraced British spies, has become a masterpiece TV series on Apple TV+. And if you're not watching it yet, you're missing out. Gary Oldman plays the main character, Jackson Lamb, who is my favorite character of all time, knocking off Ron Swanson from the top spot.

In one of my favorite moments from the series, Jackson Lamb mansplains mansplaining. It's a brilliant commentary on the toxic masculinity that can often be found in the world of spies.

But the Slow Horses series hasn't always been a success. In fact, it struggled for a while, even being dropped because of low sales. But Mick Herron persevered, and now the series has eight novels and four novellas. And I, for one, am grateful that he did.

So if you haven't read any of Mick Herron's books yet, what are you waiting for? Get started on the Slow Horses series and join me in being a fan of the best spy novel writer of our time.
