This is what your calendar can look like.

This is not a recent and real calendar from me (so don't try to book meetings in the open spaces) but it's a really good approximation of a typical week.

These would be *meetings with people*, not blocked time to do work. This may not be representative of all managers, but once a manager has a team of size 10+, they may need lots of meetings to:
- connect with members of their team for both ongoing work and career development
- understand what clients want
- synchronize with other internal teams we depend on
- perform recruiting activities (interviewing, panels, presentations)
- meetings with their own managers
- meetings with peers to ensure we're learning from each other

I am an extreme introvert, and try really hard to avoid low-value meetings. But I still do 30+ hours. So if you want to be a manager, you need to like (or at least be able to endure) talking to people for a long time each week.
