## Networking Lessons from Trees: How Suzanne Simard's Discoveries Can Help You Connect Better

I recently came across an inspiring interview with Suzanne Simard, a professor of forest ecology at the University of British Columbia. In this interview, Simard shared her groundbreaking research on the social behavior of trees, which taught me a valuable lesson on networking.

According to Simard, trees are not just individual organisms; they are social beings that communicate with each other. They share nutrients and information through a vast network of fungi that connect the roots of different trees. This Wood Wide Web, allows trees to exchange resources and help each other grow.

But what struck me the most was that trees prefer to help trees that are related to them. They recognize and remember their kin and prioritize their needs over strangers. 

Networking is not just about meeting new people; it's also about nurturing existing relationships and helping those in your network. Like trees, we should not forget those who are close to us and help them succeed. It's not just good karma; it's also good business. 

Simard's research teaches us that connections matter, and building strong relationships is crucial to success. Just like trees need each other to thrive, we need a supportive network to help us grow and reach our goals. So, if even trees can network, why shouldn't we?

We can all take a leaf out of Simard's book!
