title: 'The Productivity of Patience: What Gardening Taught Me About Career Growth'
---
<article data-clarity-region="article">


LinkedIn is an incredible platform to learn new skills and grow in your career. With so many promises of quick knowledge acquisition, it can be tempting to dive into new projects and expect instant results. However, as I learned from Vicki Boykis, it takes time and dedication to become proficient in any field.

Back in 2007, I purchased my first house that had a garden. At first, I didn't pay much attention to it, but over time, I realized that neglecting the garden wouldn't make it disappear, but rather it would deteriorate slowly until it no longer looked good. This experience taught me that results don't come instantly, that much of what we do requires patience and persistence.

Gardening also taught me that many of the things we do don't result in immediate payoff. Planting a seed and watching it grow into a beautiful flower or fruit-bearing plant can take weeks, months, or even years. However, with dedication and persistence, the payoff is the fulfillment and joy of seeing something grow and flourish.

I have applied these lessons to my career, and they have served me well. I am intentional about the things I do and strive to stay dedicated even when the results may not be immediate. I know that with time and effort, the payoff will come.

So, to all those who are seeking to learn and grow in their careers, remember that it takes time, effort, and dedication to become proficient in any field. Don't let the lack of immediate results discourage you. Keep planting seeds, investing in yourself, and the payoff will come in due time.
