<article data-clarity-region="article">


One of the most helpful team-building exercises I participated in was very simple. It was called the "goodwill account".

The exercise was for each team member to write 2-3 things that your colleagues can do that *debit* their goodwill account with you, and three things that your colleagues do that *credit* their account with you. We would then share these around the team.

For me, the debits were:
- scheduling a meeting without looking at my free/busy
- scheduling a meeting with me outside of work hours and canceling it last minute
- surprising me with an urgent deliverable request

And the credits were:
- being efficient in meetings: having an agenda, pre-reads, action items
- giving me visibility of projects I might be involved in at some point in the future
- giving me feedback on how I could do things better

It was also helpful to learn about things that annoyed my colleagues that I did without realizing.
