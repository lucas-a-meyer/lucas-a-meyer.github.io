Aging gracefully has its perks, and one silver lining is the wisdom gained from experience, which can be passed on to the younger generation to help them avoid repeating our mistakes. As time marches on, I find myself witnessing the children of my longtime friends embarking on their college journeys and even stepping into the workforce.

One of the unexpected delights of growing older is the connections I make on LinkedIn with these young adults, the offspring of my friends. This digital platform has become a bridge between generations, allowing us to engage in conversations that are both enlightening and entertaining.

These interactions often turn into a form of reverse mentorship. While I regale them with tales from my past, they keep me updated on the latest trends and lingo. Thanks to them, I now know that "dabbing" and using the term "sus" are no longer in vogue.

As the years continue to pass, I look forward to maintaining these connections and, perhaps one day, even engaging with the grandchildren of my friends. In this ever-evolving world, it's comforting to know that we can still learn from one another, regardless of age or background.
