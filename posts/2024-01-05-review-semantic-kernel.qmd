title: Tech reviewers wanted for my Semantic Kernel book

<article data-clarity-region="article">


I am wrting a book with [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) about the [Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel). If you want to help by becoming a technical reviewer, please read on.

The Microsoft Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) like [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction), [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) with conventional programming languages like C# and Python. It allows you to define plugins that can be chained together in just a few lines of code.

The book is called "Essential Guide for the Microsoft Semantic Kernel", and its intent is to provide a practical, hands-on introduction to the Semantic Kernel.

## Reviewers wanted

Packt Publishing is looking for technical reviewers to help with the book. 

Reviewers need to have some programming experience and familiarity with AI. I don't know exactly how large is the workload and what are the deadlines, but the book will have between 200 and 250 pages.

Reviewers get:

1. Credit in the book: name and bio printed on the front matter as a Technical Reviewer.
2. A complimentary print copy of the book at their doorstep.
3. Free 12-month subscription to all Packt books.

This can be a cool way of learning about the Semantic Kernel and AI, while also getting something for it.

I'm the author of the book, but I'm not involved in the selection of the reviewers, and I don't know how many reviewers will be selected. I'm just helping Packt to spread the word.
