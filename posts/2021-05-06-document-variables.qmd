When you are doing a code interview, it's possible (and even likely) that you're going to be nervous. Remember to document your thinking process.

Remember to think out loud. But also don't forget:

Comment your code. Maybe even write a quick comment of what you're going to do before you try to do it.

Name your variables and functions carefully, with a name that explains what they're going to do.

If you're writing SQL, name your CTEs and columns you create with meaningful names.

Format your code well if you have time. Your mind may be racing to finish the problem, this will help.

Of course we want candidates that can solve the interview problem, but we also want candidates that write code that is easy to understand and maintain.
