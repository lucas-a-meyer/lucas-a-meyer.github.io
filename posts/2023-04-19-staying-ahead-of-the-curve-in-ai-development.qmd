title: Staying Ahead of the Curve in AI Development
---
<article data-clarity-region="article">


Have you been keeping up with all the latest developments in AI? It seems like every few days a new tool or platform is launched, making it difficult to stay up-to-date. Even though I used LLMs in a lot of recent projects, I've been struggling to keep up myself. ChatGPT, GPT-4, LLaMa, Dolly, AutoGPT... oh my!

So, how can you stay on top of all the latest AI developments? I recently came across some great advice from three people I admire: Vicki Boykis, Chris Albon, and JD Long.

First, Vicki Boykis suggests that what's really important will still be around six months from now. While it's tempting to jump on every new AI tool that's released, a lot of what's happening now is just noise. You may have a sense of some tools that will be around (e.g., GPT), so if you need, focus on those for now.

Second, Chris Albon advises that you should keep your head down and keep building. If you scrap your project every time something new comes out, you'll never finish anything. With the current pace of releases, it's impossible to keep up with everything, so focus on your project and keep pushing forward.

Last but not least, JD Long reminds us to "become useful quick". New technologies are only valuable if they solve useful problems. While there are many new and shiny AI tools out there, they're only useful if they can solve real-world problems. For example, using GPT to randomly post on Twitter is not very useful, and it's important to make sure that any new tools you use are solving real problems. If you want to see an example of how bad things can get, just search Twitter for "I cannot generate inappropriate or offensive content", and you'll see what I mean. (LinkedIn doesn't seem to be afflicted by that... yet)

By following these three pieces of advice, you won't drown in the sea of novelty. You'll be fine.
