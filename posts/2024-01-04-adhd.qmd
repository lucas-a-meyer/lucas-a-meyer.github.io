In October 2023, lots of people with ADHD started posting about their experiences on [Threads](https://www.threads.net). Have you ever commuted to work and forgot to bring your laptop? Check. Do you frequently procrastinate a simple two-minute task for several days? Check. 

As I started seeing a [lot of myself](#symptoms) in their experiences, and realized that I developed several coping mechanisms and acquired several [coping technologies](#coping-technologies) over time, I decided to go for a full diagnosis.

This is a work in progress and it's still being updated as I go through the process.

**I am not a doctor. I am a computer scientist and economist. This is not medical advice. If you suspect you have ADHD, you should talk to a medical professional, like I did.**

# Symptoms

Whether I have ADHD or not, I do have some symptoms that are commonly associated with ADHD: 

- Difficulty getting started with tasks, even simple ones. I have gone to appointments I didn't need to because I didn't want to call to cancel the appointment.
- Difficulty putting the finishing touches on tasks. It takes me 90% of the time to do 90% of the work, and 90% of the time to do the remaining 10% of the work.
- I lose an incredible amount of things. When I was a kid, my mom was once told that about 10% of the items of the lost and found in a 300-student school were mine.
- I have a hard time focusing on things that are not interesting to me.
- I oscillate between hyperfocus and not being able to focus at all.

Despite the difficulties, I manage to function well, because I developed a lot of coping mechanisms and [technologies](#coping-technologies) over the years. 

# Why I Decided to Get Tested

The flurry of posts in Threads due to the ADHD awareness month in October 2023 got me started. Several posts described experiences that were very similar to mine. A particular story that resonated a lot with me was the story of someone who was treated for anxiety for years when they in fact had ADHD, and only got diagnosed in their 40s. 

I found out that this is a common problem. I have been undergoing treatment for anxiety, and though there was some improvement, progress has been slow. Several posts described a situation similar to mine: people that made little progress while being treated for anxiety, but once diagnosed with and treated for ADHD as adults, their situation improved significantly.

This gave me hope, prompting me to research the diagnostic process. Starting the process ended up being more confusing than helpful. The information I found online described several different processes and tests, some of which even seemed to promise a diagnostic outcome. The best advice came from Threads and it was clear: begin by consulting a medical professional and expressing your concerns, and go from there.

# The Referral

The process, at least where I live, seems to be designed to make it hard for people with ADHD to get diagnosed. I had to go through several steps, and Iâ€™m still not done. I live in the state of Washington in the United States. The experience may be different in other states or countries.

As mentioned above, the first step is to talk to a medical professional. I had a previously scheduled appointment for my annual physical just a few weeks after I decided to get tested, so I waited for that appointment in mid-October. Trying to schedule a separate appointment would have taken a lot longer. 

In the appointment, my PCP told me they would call me with a referral in a couple of days, but instead of calling me, they called my emergency contact, who forgot to tell me about it. Luckily, people in Threads kept reminding me to follow up, and I called my PCP office a few days later. I found the referral and called the psychologist office.

# The Initial Evaluation

I called the psychologist's office in early November. The first thing I needed to do was to set up an account in their system, which took a few days. Then, when the account was completed, they asked me to fill several standard medical forms, plus a two-page biography describing why I think I may have ADHD, and three questionnaires designed to assess whether I have ADHD and potentially autism, which tends to happen hand-in-hand. The questionnaires are below:

1. [Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS)](https://l.meyerperin.com/asrs)
2. [Brown ADD Scales](https://l.meyerperin.com/badds)
3. [Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)](https://l.meyerperin.com/aq)

The first questionnaire is a screening tool for ADHD. The second is a more detailed questionnaire about ADHD symptoms. The third is a screening tool for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a common comorbidity. The first six questions serve as a screening tool: if you score in the grey areas for four out of the six questions, you should definitely talk to a medical professional.

I completed the forms December 8th. After all the forms are filled, there are three more appointments to go through, and the first can only be scheduled after the forms are completed. I received a message on the day after that I should schedule the first appointment. I only managed to call back on December 22nd, and scheduled the first evaluation for January 3rd, 2024.

# The First Meeting

On Jan 3rd, 2024, I had the first meeting with the psychologist. We introduced ourselves and he asked me about the symptoms that resulted in me seeking a diagnosis. I described the symptoms I listed above, and he asked me to elaborate on each one of them. He also asked me about my childhood, and I described how I was a very good student, but I had a hard time focusing on things that were not interesting to me. I also described how I lost a lot of things, and how I had a hard time getting started with tasks.

He asked about my family history. My mom is definitely not neurotypical, but she has never sought a diagnosis. I did not have enough contact with my dad to know if he was neurotypical or not. He also asked about my children, and I told him that their school has guided me to request accomodation arrangements for them (these are called 504s). I told him that I plan to get them through an ADHD and autism evaluation as well and that the school counselor had already suggested that earlier in the year.

The whole meeting lasted about 40 minutes. We scheduled the appointment for the second meeting on January 8th, 2024.

He then gave me three more tests to fill out on my own time, which I did later at night on that same day.

- **A personality test with over 250 questions:** the test asked a lot about whether I can control other people's minds, whether I think they control my mind, and how frequently I think about suicide. It also repeated several questions about the [usual ADHD symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html). It would ask "Do you always feel distracted?" and offer four options for me to choose (False, Slightly True, Mostly True, True). Later, it would ask "Do you frequently feel distracted?", and show the four options again. This one took a while to get through.
- **[The Big Five personality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits):** a standard personality test with about 50 questions, which was somewhat quick to get through.
- **An attention test called [IVA-AE2](https://www.braintrain.com/ivaae2/):** this test repeatedly shows an image of a number and speaks another number. For example, it can show 2 and speak "six". You are assigned two different target numbers, one to click when you see it and another to click when you hear it. It then speaks and shows random numbers for 20 minutes. For example, if you are assigned the number "3 when seen" and "5 when heard", you should click if it shows 3 and speaks 6, you should also click if it shows 2 and speaks 5, but you should not click when it shows 5 and speaks 3. I think it's pretty normal to make the mistake of clicking when you hear the number you're supposed to click only when you see and vice-versa, and I'm sure I made plenty of mistakes, but I think most people would. This test was very tiring.

# Coping Technologies

Over time I acquired a lot of products to help me cope with the [symptoms](#symptoms). I will list them below:

{{< include _affiliate.qmd >}}

- **[Microsoft To-Do](https://l.meyerperin.com/todo):** I use Microsoft To-Do to keep track of tasks. I like it because it's **very** simple, it's multiplatform, so I can see and check tasks from my phone, my computer and my watch. Since it integrates well with Siri, I can add tasks simply by saying 'Hey Siri, remind me to X', which helps me keep track of things. I specifically add tasks to my to-do list as I'm starting them, because that will help me remember to finish if I get distracted.
- **[Apple AirTags](https://l.meyerperin.com/airtags):** I have these on everything since I lose something almost daily. The new AirTags have a feature called Precision Finding that allows me to find things a lot faster, and I use it a lot.
- **[Wallet with keyring](https://l.meyerperin.com/keyring_wallet)**: A wallet with an attached keyring allows me to carry my badge, car and house keys, wallet, and an AirTag all together, making it hard for me to lose things.
- **[S-biner carabiners](https://l.meyerperin.com/sbiner):** I use these to attach things to my backpack and to each other, so I have only one bundle of items to keep track of.
- **[Ray-Ban Meta](https://l.meyerperin.com/rayban_meta):** works as a headset and as reading glasses. It also has a camera, which I use quite a lot, and an AI that I don't use as much yet.
- **[ReMarkable 2](https://l.meyerperin.com/ReMarkable2):** during the years, I had (and lost) many notebooks and loose sheets of paper. The ReMarkable2 is an e-ink notebook that feels like a real notebook, but has a lot of capacity. I can also carry academic papers on it. 
- **[Pillbox](https://l.meyerperin.com/pillbox):** I use a pillbox to organize my vitamins and medications. I usually forget whether I took the medication or not a few hours after the time I was supposed to take it, so I use the pillbox to keep track of whether I took it or not.

# Reactions

I posted about my experience in Threads, and I got a lot of reactions. Most people are supportive and describe their own experiences being diagnosed. Some people, however, are skeptical. They say that ADHD is overdiagnosed, and that it's a fad, or a quick excuse to be lazy and forgetful. While I disagree, I have seen some websites that promise a "quick and easy" diagnosis and to get you medications fast. It feels similar to advertisements for Viagra and off-label Ozempic.

# What about you?

If you suspect you may have ADHD, I recommend that you talk to a medical professional. Your PCP is a good place to start. Online communities, such as the ones in Threads, can also be a good place to start.
