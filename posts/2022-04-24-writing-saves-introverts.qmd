I don't like talking to people, but I don't mind writing to them.

A little over a decade ago, during my MBA at #UWFoster, somebody I really admire told me: "you're good at keeping in touch with the people you know".

Truth is, I'm not that good at keeping in touch for many reasons, one of which being that I'm an extreme #introvert and initiating social interactions takes a lot of energy for me.

More recently, though, I found that #writing takes good care of that. Many people that I wanted to keep in touch with ended up getting in touch with me because of my writing here on #LinkedIn.

It works like MAGIC. It's a lot easier for me to keep the conversations going after someone reaches out, and knowing what people I care about are currently doing honestly made my life better.

Of course, that works for me because I like writing, and even with three kids, I manage to find enough peace and quiet that I get to write from time to time. Some people find it better to "never have lunch alone", or have a packed schedule of coffee meetings. Even as an introvert, I found that keeping in touch was important for me: I just needed to find a way that worked for me.
