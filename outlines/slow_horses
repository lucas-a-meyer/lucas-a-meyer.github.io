- Mick Herron is now being heralded as the best spy novel writer of our generation
- His Slow Horses series became a masterpiece TV series in Apple TV+
- Gary Oldman plays the main character of the series, Jackson Lamb, who is my favorite character of all time, knocking off Ron Swanson
- In one of my favorite moments, Jackson Lamb mansplains mansplaining
- The series has 8 novels and 4 novellas, but it struggled for a while, even being dropped because of low sales
- Those are tough times, but I'm glad that Mick Herron persevered
