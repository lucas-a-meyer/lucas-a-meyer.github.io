I gave two short talks for the 10th Arvato Financial Services Telekommunikationsforum in Baden-Baden. The way ticket prices worked out, it was US$ 1000 cheaper to return on Sunday than it was to return on Saturday, so I was able to spend a full day in Frankfurt.

I hope to come back.

## A great base for European adventures

One of the things I liked the most about Frankfurt was how integrated the transportation system was. I landed at the Frankfurt airport, where I could stay at pretty good and reasonably priced hotels (Hilton, Hilton Garden Inn and Sheraton), had a supermarket and restaurants, and could take trains and planes to anywhere else in Europe.

I stayed at the Hilton, which had the unexpected advantage of having a lot of British and American channels available on the TV and the truly appreciated advantage of having a good air-conditioning system.

## Frankfurt Itself

Frankfurt itself was touristic enough for me: the city center has plenty of attractions. Several museums, a Zoo, "The Cathedral", and all those great restaurants that you expect to exist in the center of a city in Europe. Saturday had street vendors all over downtown. I could have done a better job of planning what to do, but spending a day in the city center was plenty of fun, so I just took a train from the Airport to downtown and spent the day there enjoying the museums, the downtown and the restaurants.
