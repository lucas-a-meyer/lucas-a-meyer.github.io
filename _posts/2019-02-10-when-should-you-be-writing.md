An old Ph.D. student motto is that you should **always** be writing.

Always.

For no good reason, I'm going to try to blog every day for 100 days. This will of course mean that there will be a lot of posts that are going to be low quality, like this one.

I am flabbergasted that [Scott Greenfield](http://blog.simplejustice.us/) and [Andrew Gelman](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/) find time to write insightful posts every day, and sometimes more than one post per day. Scott usually writes two posts per day, including weekends, on top of his parenting, which is on top of his day job.

One of the expected outcomes is that I'll become better with Markdown. I'm seeing things like [pagedown](https://github.com/StackExchange/pagedown) coming into play, and it seems like writing in Markdown might soon take over writing in LaTeX. A good introduction on generating almost anything from Markdown can be found in Jake Zimmerman's [post](https://blog.jez.io/reach-for-markdown/).
