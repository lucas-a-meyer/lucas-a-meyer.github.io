Meyer\ndate: 2022-07-07\n---\n\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this article is to show how to use Quarto to generate an article just like this, hopefully with better content. \nThis is just a demonstration of how powerful Quarto is to generate multiple artifacts from substantially the same content/code.\n\nYou can see how I have done this in <https://www.meyerperin.com/using-quarto>.\n\n# Population changes\n\nOver the last few decades, the number of children per woman has been declining and overall longevity has been increasing.\n\nThis has been markedly the case in Asia. Although Japan is frequently remembered as a country with low fertility rates, several other countries now have a fertility rate at or below Japan's levels, even China, as shown in @fig-fertility.\n\n![Fertility rates in Asia](images/asia-fertility.png){#fig-fertility}\n\nThe outcome of these changes is that over the next few decades, the proportion of children and working adults will go down in many countries,\nand the proportion of older adults will increase. This is detailed in @sec-dependency-ratio and the projected status for several countries is shown in @sec-world-tour.\n\n## Dependency ratio {#sec-dependency-ratio}\n\nDemographers use a metric called **Dependency Ratio** (@eq-dep-ratio) to evaluate how many non-working people are supported by 100 working people.\n\n$$\n\\text{Dependency Ratio} = 100 \\times \\frac{\\text{Non-working population}}{\\text{Working population}}\n$$ {#eq-dep-ratio}\n\n# World tour {#sec-world-tour}\n\nIn the figures below, I further decompose the dependency ratio into Young (0-20 years-old), Old (65-79 years-old) and Very Old (80+ years-old). \nNote that Young, Old and Very Old are terms used by demographers. \n\nI don't mean any personal judgment when using this classification of \"young\", \"old\" and \"very old\". One of my favorite writers,\nJared Diamond, who wrote _Guns, Germs and Steel_ [@diamond97] and _Collapse_ @diamond11, is currently 84-years old and I hope to have his \ndisposition at that age.\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## Age and Population Pyramids for Italy\n<div class=\"columns\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-4.png){}\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-7.png){}\n</div>\n</div>\n## Age and Population Pyramids for China\n<div class=\"columns\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-13.png){}\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-16.png){}\n</div>\n</div>\n## Age and Population Pyramids for Brazil\n<div class=\"columns\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-22.png){}\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-25.png){}\n</div>\n</div>\n## Age and Population Pyramids for India\n<div class=\"columns\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-31.png){}\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-34.png){}\n</div>\n</div>\n## Age and Population Pyramids for Japan\n<div class=\"columns\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-40.png){}\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-43.png){}\n</div>\n</div>\n## Age and Population Pyramids for Nigeria\n<div class=\"columns\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-49.png){}\n</div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n![](article_files/figure-docx/cell-5-output-52.png){}\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n# References\n\n:::{#refs}\n:::\n\n",
