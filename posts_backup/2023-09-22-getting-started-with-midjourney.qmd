title: Getting started with Midjourney

I've added a new section to my blog, called [A Quick Tour of Midjourney](https://links.meyerperin.com/mj). 

You can find it here: <https://links.meyerperin.com/mj>.

If you never used Midjourney before, or if you tried to use it but got quickly intimidated by the volume of messages in their Discord server, this will probably help.

An important note: Midjourney is now a paid service, so you have to pay for a subscription (currently $10/month) to use it. There are no trials anymore.
