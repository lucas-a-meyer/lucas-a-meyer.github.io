Once upon a time, as I got older and busier, I stumbled upon a life hack that has kept me on top of things like a superhero on caffeine. You see, in the realm of productivity, people can be as passionate about their to-do applications as sports fans are about their favorite teams. Personally, I've become a Microsoft To-Do devotee (even during my Amazonian days), but fear not, my trick works for all.

Picture this: every time a task pops into my head, before I even start, I add it to my to-do list. It's as easy as pie, thanks to my trusty sidekick, Siri. With a simple "Hey Siri, remind me to...", my task is whisked away to my digital list, ready for action.

Now, you might be wondering how Siri and Microsoft To-Do became such fast friends. The secret lies in setting the default tasks list to one that resides in Microsoft To-Do. Voilï¿½! A match made in productivity heaven.

I can't even begin to count the times I've remembered a task, only to be interrupted and then forget about it entirely. But with the magic words "Hey Siri, remind me to...", I can rest assured that my to-do list has my back.

The best part? This trick works everywhere - in my car, at the office, and even in the shower (thanks to my Apple Watch). Since I can't turn back the hands of time or slow down my hectic life, this little life hack has become my secret weapon in the battle against forgetfulness.

So, my fellow productivity warriors, give it a try and let the magic of "Hey Siri, remind me to..." transform your to-do list into a well-oiled machine.
