<p>This is a review of <a href="https://badlandsranch.com/">Badlands Ranch</a>, a dry dog food. I am not affiliated with the company in any way and I don’t receive any compensation for this review.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Our dog, TheFuzzy, is very picky with food. She will go into hunger strikes for an extended period of time if she dislikes the food. The first brand that worked reliably for us was <a href="../posts/2022-06-28-farmers-dog.html">The Farmer’s Dog</a>. The main drawback of that food is that it’s wet and frozen. It takes a fair amount of freezer space, the kids don’t like to handle it, it’s hard to travel with. We tried a few other brands, but none of them worked. Then we found <a href="https://badlandsranch.com/">Badlands Ranch</a>, a dry food funded by the actress Katherine Heigl, and decided to give it a try.</p>
<p>You can order the food on their <a href="https://www.badlandsranch.com">website</a>. They run promotions that give big discounts on the first order, but they seem to run promotions giving big discounts all the time.</p>
<section id="what-you-should-know" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-you-should-know">What you should know</h2>
<p>Here’s a few things that you should know before you try that are not obvious from the website:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>packages are small</strong>, containing only 10 cups of food each. My dog is 40 lbs, and she needs 2.5 cups per day, so each package lasts only 4 days.</li>
<li>The food is <strong>expensive</strong>: if you buy the 6-bag bundle, it’s $203.70 for 60 cups, or $3.40 per cup. That’s $8.50 per day for my dog. Blue Buffalo food, a premium brand of wet food, is about $6.50 per day for my dog.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, my dog reliably likes it. Because it’s dry food, we can travel with it. It’s fairly calorie-dense, so it’s easy to carry a few days worth of food in a small bag. It’s also easy to store, and it doesn’t smell. The kids feed the dog without complaining, and the dog eats mostly without complaining, so it works well for us. Unless we’re eating pizza, in which case the dog will refuse to eat anything else. But you can’t blame her for that.</p>
</section>
<section id="promotions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="promotions">Promotions</h2>
Sometimes Badlands Ranch runs big promotions for large orders - I recently ordered 12 packages for $312.80. That’s $2.60 per cup, or $6.50 per day for my dog, same as Blue Buffalo. They send you a large (and annoying) number of emails, so you’ll know when they run promotions, even if you don’t really want to.

<article data-clarity-region="article">
<p>If you have been following the news for the last few years, you have seen how much the prevalence of misinformation, disinformation (intentional misinformation), and propaganda (intentional misinformation by state actors) has increased a lot. Most topics of interest online have a shocking proportion of misinformation: Ukraine, COVID, elections, etc.</p>
<p>Determining whether a news article is fake or not is a difficult problem for both people and computer models. This ACM survey paper (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3395046" class="uri">https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3395046</a>) gives a good idea about the state of the art around 2020. It is far from a solved problem.</p>
<p>As you would expect, computer scientists break difficult problems into parts, and even the subtasks for fake news detection are hard. A few examples of subtasks are detecting if the headline matches the content of the news, evaluating the reputation of who is sharing the news, evaluating the reputation of the news website, etc.</p>
<p>For this latter task, a product I have found to be useful is NewsGuard <a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/" class="uri">https://www.newsguardtech.com/</a>. Although NewsGuard has been (in my opinion, fairly) criticized a few years ago for having a bias towards the left, it has been improving continuously. These days, I find it very helpful, especially since I study disinformation and fraud for a living, and therefore my browsing patterns are… atypical.</p>
<p>It helps that NewsGuard is free for users of Microsoft Edge. You can install a NewsGuard extension and it will show whether the site you are seeing is trustworthy. It will also integrate with Bing when used in Edge, and show a badge next to each result.</p>
<p>If you want to try it out, the following link has the instructions: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/newsguard-b28e453e-568c-4d57-98ef-c61056f99462" class="uri">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/newsguard-b28e453e-568c-4d57-98ef-c61056f99462</a>. Note that it’s only free for Microsoft Edge, which is a great browser that runs in a number of platforms such as Linux, Mac, etc.</p>

Moved to Badlands Ranch Dog Food
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>As of November 2023, we have moved to <a href="../posts/2023-11-03-badlands_ranch.html">Badlands Ranch Dog Food</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The review below is about The Farmer’s Dog, which we used for over a year. In November 2023, we moved to <a href="../posts/2023-11-03-badlands_ranch.html">Badlands Ranch dog food</a>, which ended up being a lot more convenient for about the same price, and similarly appreciated by my dog.</p>
<p>I did not receive any compensation for this review, and I’m not affiliated with Badlands Ranch or The Farmer’s Dog in any way.</p>
<p>If you want to read my earlier review of the Farmer’s Dog, read on. My new review of Badlands Ranch is <a href="../posts/2023-11-03-badlands_ranch.html">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I recently subscribed to the Farmer’s Dog. I love it, even though I didn’t expect to.</p>
<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>My dog, TheFuzzy, is a standard schnauzer. She is very picky with her food, and would do very long hunger strikes to prove her point. She doesn’t like dry food, and we have been feeding her wet food for a while. Even so, she resists: if she sees us eating human food, she will want to participate. To address that, we needed to feed her before we start cooking for ourselves, or she would “protest” with a hunger strike.</p>

</section>
<section id="freakonomics-on-venture-capital" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="freakonomics-on-venture-capital">Freakonomics on Venture Capital</h2>
<p>One day, I was listening to a <a href="https://freakonomics.com/podcast/is-venture-capital-the-secret-sauce-of-the-american-economy/">Freakonomics podcast on venture capital</a>. In that episode, they interviewed Jonathan Regev, the founder of the <a href="https://www.thefarmersdog.com">Farmer’s Dog</a> who talked about how hard it would have been for their company to scale without venture capital. I was, at that very moment, about to feed my dog, and decided to give it a try.</p>
</section>
<section id="signing-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="signing-up">Signing Up</h2>
<p>Signing up to the Farmer’s Dog, as expected from something backed by VC, was very easy. I had to answer a (cute) questionnaire asking about my dog, her weight, and her food preferences. The result was a recommended food plan with a calculated number of calories, and a discounted price for a few weeks (I don’t remember if it was two or three).</p>
</section>
<section id="what-i-didnt-like" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-didnt-like">What I didn’t like</h2>
<p>The first thing I didn’t like was that the number of calories was on the low side. Using <a href="https://vetcalculators.com/calories.html">another web calculator</a>, I found that my dog would need 946kcal/day. The Farmer’s Dog calculator gave me less than 500kcal/day, about half of what I thought I needed, and about half of what I was currently feeding her.</p>
<p>The second thing was the price: after removing the initial discount, the price was about the same of the food I was currently using… but for half the calories.</p>
<p>The next thing was my own fault: I was counting on using the food right away, but it arrives deeply frozen, and I needed to wait about 36h for it to unfreeze. The package was a little unwieldy: the food comes as a paste in sealed plastic bag. I needed to use scissors to cut the top of the package and press out the paste into the bowl. It is hard to measure the exact quantity, and easy to get one’s hand dirty, which makes it harder to convince my kids to do it. Measuring the right amount is also tricky.</p>
<p>The food needs to be frozen, defrosted and kept refrigerated. That makes it inconvenient to use it in travel.</p>
<p>Did I hate it? For the first few days I thought I would, but…</p>
</section>
<section id="what-i-liked" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-liked">What I liked</h2>
<p>The Farmer’s Dog excels where it matters: the dog eats the food like there’s no tomorrow. I wouldn’t even need to clean the bowl. The only other case when I see her eating like that when she’s eating human food. Being a careful scientist, I thought this could be because she was hungry due to the lower calories, but I tested that she devours the food even after getting a lot of calories from other foods in prior meals. She really likes the food. I think it’s a staple of VC investments that they want to sell solutions rather than products, and this solved my main problem.</p>
<p>The downside: I had to adjust the calorie count up, which meant that the Farmer’s Dog is now more expensive than my previous food.</p>
</section>
<section id="my-verdict" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-verdict">My verdict</h2>
<p>My final verdict: I think it’s worthwhile giving it a try.</p>
